Folate­vitamin B-12 interaction in relation to cognitive impairment,
anemia, and biochemical indicators of vitamin B-12 deficiency1­5
Jacob Selhub, Martha Savaria Morris, Paul F Jacques, and Irwin H Rosenberg
ABSTRACT
Previous reports on pernicious anemia treatment suggested that high
folic acid intake adversely influences the natural history of vitamin
B-12 deficiency, which affects many elderly individuals. However,
experimental investigation of this hypothesis is unethical, and the
few existing observational data are inconclusive. With the use of data
from the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES), we evaluated the interaction between high serum
folate and low vitamin B-12 status [ie, plasma vitamin B-12 ,
148 pmol/L or methylmalonic acid (MMA) . 210 nmol/L] with re-
spect to anemia and cognitive impairment. With subjects having both
plasma folate 59 nmol/L and normal vitamin B-12 status as the
referent category, odds ratios for the prevalence of anemia compared
with normal hemoglobin concentration and impaired compared with
unimpaired cognitive function were 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1, 3.7) and 1.7
(95% CI: 1.01, 2.9), respectively, for those with low vitamin B-12
status but normal serum folate and 4.9 (95% CI: 2.3, 10.6) and
5.0 (95% CI: 2.7, 9.5), respectively, for those with low vitamin
B-12 status and plasma folate .59 nmol/L. Among subjects
with low vitamin B-12 status, mean circulating vitamin B-12 was
228 pmol/L for the normal-folate subgroup and 354 pmol/L for
the high-folate subgroup. We subsequently showed increases in cir-
culating homocysteine and MMA concentrations with increasing se-
rum folate among NHANES participants with serum vitamin B-12 ,
148 pmol/L, whereas the opposite trends occurred among subjects
with serum vitamin B-12 ! 148 pmol/L. These interactions, which
were not seen in NHANES III before fortification, imply that, in
vitamin B-12 deficiency, high folate status is associated with im-
paired activity of the 2 vitamin B-12­dependent enzymes, methionine
synthase and MMA­coenzyme A mutase. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;

INTRODUCTION
Folate and vitamin B-12 interrelation
The vitamins folic acid and B-12 serve as coenzymes in one-
carbon metabolism. Specifically, a carbon unit from serine or
glycine reacts with tetrahydrofolate (THF) to form methylene-
THF. This may be used for the synthesis of thymidylate, a DNA
nucleotide, or for purine synthesis. Folate deficiency-related
macrocytic anemia is due to failure of precursor blood cells to
divide because of a lack of DNA. The adverse effect of vitamin
B-12 deficiency on DNA synthesis is explained by the ``meth-
ylfolate trap hypothesis'' (1). Vitamin B-12 acts as a cofactor for
methionine synthase (MS), which catalyzes the remethylation of
homocysteine to methionine. The methyl group is donated by
methyl-THF, which is derived by the irreversible reduction of
methylene-THF to methyl-THF by methylene-THF reductase.
If MS is inactivated by a lack of vitamin B-12, the result is
a functional folate deficiency (ie, a lack of the nonmethylated
folates needed for serine-glycine interconversion and the syn-
thesis of purines and pyrimidines) as folate becomes in-
creasingly ``trapped'' as methyl-THF.
Hyperhomocysteinemia is another consequence of deficiencies
of either folate or vitamin B-12 (2). This effect is due, in part, to
the requirement by MS for both folate and vitamin B-12. Fur-
thermore, a considerable proportion of the methionine that
results from homocysteine remethylation is converted to
S-adenosylmethionine, which regulates the one-carbon pathway
by inhibiting methylene-THF reductase and activating the
homocysteine-disposing enzyme, cystathionine-b synthase.
S-adenosylmethionine also serves as the sole methyl donor for
the central nervous system, which may explain associations
between folate deficiency and vitamin B-12 deficiency and
cognitive impairment and mental illness (3, 4). One of the most
devastating consequences of vitamin B-12 deficiency is a classic
neuropathy called combined degeneration of the spinal cord (5).
The mechanism by which vitamin B-12 deficiency leads to this
fatal demyelinating illness is unknown, but its specific link to
vitamin B-12 deficiency, but not folate deficiency, may provide
a clue to the causal pathway.
Another unique consequence of vitamin B-12 deficiency
relates to its role in the isomerization of L-methylmalonyl­

coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA--a reaction that, unlike the
remethylation of homocysteine, occurs in the mitochondria and
does not involve folate. Thus, vitamin B-12 deficiency specifi-
cally results in increased methylmalonic acid (MMA) concen-
trations in both plasma and urine.
Pernicious anemia and excessive intake of folic acid
After studying malnourished pregnant women in India in the
late 1920s, Lucy Wills described a macrocytic anemia that shared
some features with the blood abnormalities of elderly Europeans
with pernicious anemia (6). For example, the cytologic proper-
ties of the 2 anemias were identical, and both types responded
well to crude liver extract. However, only the tropical illness
responded to yeast extract. Furthermore, although purified liver
extract had proved effective in the treatment of pernicious
anemia, it did not cure the tropical form (6). This difference in
response between the 2 anemias led to the suggestion that the
``Wills factor'' in the yeast extract was distinct from the ``ex-
trinsic factor'' in the purified liver extract. This hypothesis was
subsequently verified. However, the identification of vitamin
B-12 as the anti­pernicious anemia factor in liver (7) followed
the isolation of folic acid from yeast (8) by several years, during
which time folic acid was administered in large doses to patients
with pernicious anemia (9). Because the inappropriateness of
this treatment quickly became apparent, reports of cases thus
treated in the late 1940s and early 1950s comprise the entire
body of literature on the effect of folic acid administration on
persons deficient for vitamin B-12 (10­12).
Reviews of the historic case reports allude to rapid neurologic
deterioration after improvement of anemia (10, 11). Conse-
quently, the idea has developed that excessive intake of folic
acid can obscure or mask vitamin B-12 deficiency and poten-
tially delay its diagnosis until neurologic consequences become
irreversible (13). Although some have questioned the connection
between masking and either the diagnosis of vitamin B-12 de-
ficiency or neurologic damage (14­18), Chodos and Ross (10)
described the neurologic deterioration that occurred after folic
acid administration as ``explosive'' and suggested that folic acid
might actually exert a detrimental effect on the central nervous
system. Furthermore, Israels and Wilkinson (11) wrote that
``some patients who had not previously shown signs of nervous
system disturbances developed such signs, often very acutely,
after being treated with folic acid for variable periods'' (p 1072).
Food folic acid fortification and the debate on folic acid
safety
The move by the United States and other governments to
fortify staple food products with folic acid for the prevention of
neural tube defects rekindled the debate over the safety of folic
acid for the elderly, who are at high risk of vitamin B-12 de-
ficiency. On the basis of the historic case reports, as well as the
known metabolic interaction between folate and vitamin B-12,
and animal data showing a link between folate supplementation
and rapid development of neuropathology in animal deficient for
vitamin B-12, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of
Medicine called the evidence for precipitation or exacerbation
of the neurologic damage of vitamin B-12 deficiency by excess
supplemental folate intake ``suggestive'' and selected that end-
point, which was associated with intakes ! 5 mg/d, as the critical
endpoint for the development of a tolerable upper intake for folate
(13). Division of 5 mg/d by an uncertainty factor of 5 resulted in
an upper intake of 1 mg/d. The high degree of uncertainty led
some to question the safety of fortification (19, 20) and inspired
others to criticize the upper intake as too conservative (21, 22).
Particularly in light of continued demands for a higher level of
fortification (23, 24), clearly defining the benefits and risks of
high folic acid intake assumes vital importance. Writing about
this challenge, Moore (25) observed that the current fortification
program provides the perfect opportunity for epidemiologic
study of the unanswered questions, including those related to the
interaction between folate and vitamin B-12.
Folate status and intake in the era of folic acid fortification
Mandatory folic acid fortification of enriched cereal grain
products sold in the United States officially took effect in January
1998 (26). Not surprisingly, the first report on the program's
effect showed that fortification resulted in a marked increase in
folate status (27, 28). Specifically, mean plasma folate increased
from 4.6 ng/mL (11 nmol/L) before fortification to 10.0 ng/mL
(23 nmol/L) after fortification (P , 0.001). Furthermore, the
prevalence of folate deficiency decreased from 22.0% to 1.7%.
Although the mandated fortification of 140 lg folic acid/100 g
flour was estimated to increase folic acid intake by '100 lg/d (26),
our estimates (29) and those of others (30) suggest that the ac-
tual increase in intake from fortification was about twice that
high. Furthermore, because of the combined intake of fortified
cereal grain products, vitamin supplements, and voluntarily
fortified breakfast cereals, a substantial proportion of Framing-
ham Offspring Cohort members consumed .1 mg folic acid/d.
Indeed, 11% of supplement-using cohort members and '0.3%
of nonusers exceeded the upper intake amount (29).
To test the hypothesis that the high folate status achievable in
the era of mandatory folic acid fortification affects the con-
sequences of vitamin B-12 deficiency, either by a masking
phenomenon or by exacerbating neurologic effects, we used data
collected in recent versions of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) to evaluate the interaction be-
tween high serum folate and low vitamin B-12 status in relation to
several outcomes linked to vitamin B-12 deficiency; namely,
anemia, macrocytosis, cognitive impairment, elevated homo-
cysteine concentrations, and elevated MMA concentrations (31,
32). We review and discuss the results of these studies here.
METHODS
We used data collected in the NHANES conducted during the
postfortification years 1999­2002. Senior survey participants (ie,
those aged !60 y), the only group whose cognitive function was
assessed, numbered 3706. Of the 1684 subjects who met eligi-
bility requirements, complete data for analyses pertaining to
anemia were available for 1458 subjects, and complete data for
analyses pertaining to cognitive function were available for 1302
subjects. Demographic and health data were collected by in-
terview, and cognitive function was assessed by using a version of
the Digit Symbol-Substitution subtest of the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale III--a screening test designed to detect cog-
nitive impairment in adults and children (33). Blood samples
FOLATE­VITAMIN B-12 INTERACTION 703S
were drawn and analyzed for biochemical markers, and a com-
plete blood count was performed.
We defined low vitamin B-12 status as serum vitamin B-12 ,
148 pmol/L or serum MMA . 210 nmol/L [ie, above the pub-
lished reference range for serum vitamin B-12­replete survey
participants with normal serum creatinine concentrations (34)].
We defined anemia according to criteria from the World Health
Organization[ie,hemoglobin,12g/dLforwomenand,13g/dL
for men (35)], and macrocytosis as a mean cell volume . 99 fL.
Finally, we used distribution-based cutoffs to define high serum
folate (ie, !59 nmol/L, the 80th percentile) and cognitive im-
pairment (ie, Digit Symbol-Substitution subtest score , 34/133,
the 20th percentile).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Interaction between vitamin B-12 status and serum folate
in relation to anemia and cognition in NHANES 1999­2002
Data displayed in Table 1 summarize the interaction between
serum folate and vitamin B-12 status in relation to anemia and
cognitive impairment as seen in NHANES 1999­2002 (31) and
address the potential role of homocysteine in the associations.
The tabulated data show that having low vitamin B-12 status,
regardless of serum folate, was associated with a significantly
increased prevalence of both anemia and cognitive impairment.
Furthermore, compared with having normal status for both vi-
tamins, having high serum folate but normal vitamin B-12 status
was associated with a reduced prevalence of anemia and a sig-
nificantly reduced prevalence of cognitive impairment. The
worst combination was low vitamin B-12 status and high serum
folate. Specifically, anemia and cognitive impairment were ob-
served '5 times as often in the group with that combination as
in the group with normal vitamin B-12 status and normal serum
folate. That the odds ratios were only modestly affected by
controlling for homocysteine concentrations suggests that the
hematologic and cognitive risks and benefits were not directly
affected by homocysteine increases or decreases.
These data represent important epidemiologic evidence of an
adverse interaction between high folate status and low vitamin
B-12 status. Consequently, they seem to support the idea that the
neuropsychiatric consequences of vitamin B-12 deficiency are
exacerbated by high folate status. We also noted with interest that,
in the Nurses' Health Study, although multivitamin users in the
highest plasma vitamin B-12 quartile category preformed some-
what better on cognitive function tests than did subjects who did
not use supplements and were in the lowest quartile category for
plasma vitamin B-12 (mean difference in global cognitive
score: 20.18; 95% CI: 2043, 0.07), multivitamin users who
were, nevertheless, in the lowest vitamin B-12 quartile category
performed worse than the comparison subjects (mean difference
in global cognitive score: 0.19; 95% CI: 2043, 0.07) (21). Be-
cause folic acid is a normal constituent of multivitamin pills,
these findings may also reflect the adverse interaction between
high folate status and low vitamin B-12 status in relation to
cognition.
Our observation of a higher prevalence of not only cognitive
impairment but also anemia in association with high folate status
among American seniors deficient for vitamin B-12 suggests that
the interaction is a general biological phenomenon (ie, that it
affects all health consequences of vitamin B-12 deficiency). This
finding also seems to be supported by a report from Pune, India,
of a higher prevalence of hyperglycemia (which was associated
with maternal vitamin B-12 deficiency) among children born to
mothers deficient for vitamin B-12 with high folate status than
among children born to mothers deficient for vitamin B-12 with
lower folate status (20).
Interaction between circulating vitamin B-12 and folate
concentrations in relation to circulating concentrations
of the 2 indicators of vitamin B-12 function, homocysteine
and MMA
In this study of the general US population in the age of folic
acid fortification (32), we found that homocysteine does not
generally decrease with increasing folate status among people
with low serum concentrations of vitamin B-12 (Table 2).
Specifically, although geometric mean homocysteine and geo-
metric mean MMA decreased significantly across increasing
serum folate categories among survey participants with serum
vitamin B-12 ! 148 pmol/L (P , 0.001), the opposite trends
were observed for subjects with serum vitamin B-12 , 148
pmol/L. Furthermore, geometric mean homocysteine for sub-
jects with low serum vitamin B-12 and serum folate , 19.3

nmol/L was in the normal range and close to that of subjects in
the same serum folate category with higher serum vitamin B-12.
However, the mean for the group with low serum vitamin B-12
and serum folate . 32.6 nmol/L was nearly 12 lmol/L, a com-
monly used cutoff for hyperhomocystinemia, and serum MMA
was extremely elevated.
In vitamin B-12 deficiency, high homocysteine reflects im-
paired MS activity, whereas high MMA indicates impaired
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity. Consequently, our findings
suggest that both pathways of vitamin B-12 metabolism are
adversely affected by high serum folate despite the direct in-
volvement of folate only in MS activity. Simultaneous impair-
ment of both pathways is normally caused by insufficient intake
of vitamin B-12 or by the disruption of early steps in vitamin
B-12 processing (1, 23). The latter include intrinsic factor-
mediated intestinal absorption, formation of the vitamin B-12­
transcobalamin II complex in plasma, transport of the complex
into peripheral tissue by a receptor-mediated endocytosis, in-
corporation of the complex into lysosomes, dissociation of the
complex and exit of vitamin B-12 as acquocob(III)alamin into
the cytosol, and reduction to cob(II)alamin for subsequent dis-
tribution to MS in the cytosol or to the mitochondria. The event
that effects the simultaneous disruption of both pathways could
also occur after the distribution of vitamin B-12 to the respective
compartments in the course of rendering the vitamin available
for interaction with the respective enzyme proteins or during
catalysis.
We found no adverse interactions between high serum folate
and low vitamin B-12 status among participants of the NHANES
III, which took place in 1991­1994, before mandatory food folate
fortification took effect (19). Although most of the seniors with
serum folate concentrations . 59 nmol/L who participated in
the 1999­2002 NHANES achieved their high folate status
through the combined intake of enriched cereal grain products,
fortified breakfast cereals, and multivitamins, the influence of
fortification is indicated by the 40% prevalence of serum
folate . 59 nmol/L among supplement-using seniors who par-
ticipated in the 1999­2002 NHANES, compared with a 10%
prevalence among comparable participants in the NHANES III.
Note that most subjects with high folate status consumed sup-
plemental vitamin B-12 and absorbed it. Indeed, mean vitamin
B-12 concentration (95% CI) for senior 1999­2002 NHANES
participants with low vitamin B-12 status and high serum folate
was 354 pmol/L (95% CI: 309, 406 pmol/L) compared with 242
pmol/L (95% CI: 228, 257 pmol/L) for the subgroup with low
vitamin B-12 status and normal serum folate. Although un-
published results of our analyses of Framingham Study data
showed that 80% of the folate ingested by people with circu-
lating folate concentrations . 50 nmol/L was in the form of
folic acid, it remains to be determined whether the interaction we
observed is a unique consequence of circulating unmetabolized
folic acid or merely the result of a high total (ie, both reduced and
oxidized) mass of body folate (Other articles in this supplement to
the Journal include references 36­39).
