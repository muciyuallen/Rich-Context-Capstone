Abstract
Objective: To examine the epidemiology of hypertension in women of reproductive age.
Methods: Using NHANES from 1999­2008, we identified 5,521 women age 20­44 years old. Hypertension status was
determined using blood pressure measurements and/or self-reported medication use.
Results: The estimated prevalence of hypertension in women of reproductive age was 7.7% (95% confidence interval (CI):
6.9%­8.5%). The prevalence of anti-hypertensive pharmacologic therapy was 4.2% (95% CI 3.5%­4.9%). The prevalence of
hypertension was relatively stable across the study period; the age and race adjusted odds of hypertension in 2007­2008
did not differ significantly from 1999­2000 (odds ratio 1.2, CI 0.8 to 1.7, p = 0.45). Significant independent risk factors
associated with hypertension included older age, non-Hispanic black race (compared to non-Hispanic whites), diabetes
mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and higher body mass index. The most commonly used antihypertensive medications
included diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), and beta blockers.
Conclusion: Hypertension occurs in about 8% of women of reproductive age. There are remarkable differences in the
prevalence of hypertension between racial/ethnic groups. Obesity is a risk factor of particular importance in this population
because it affects over 30% of young women in the U.S., is associated with more than 4 fold increased risk of hypertension,
and is potentially modifiable.

Introduction
Hypertension is a highly prevalent chronic medical condition
affecting more than 65 million people in the United States [1,2]. It
is the leading reason for physician office visits, accounting for
approximately 42 million ambulatory encounters each year, and is
among the leading indications for the use of prescription drugs [3].
While in general, women of reproductive age have relatively low
rates of hypertension, it presents important clinical implications
and challenges [4] in this population, not only because of its role as
a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but also because of the
issues associated with this condition and its treatment in
pregnancy.
It is well established that young women with hypertension have
increased risk for cardiovascular disease in both the short and the
long term [5]. Rates of cardiovascular disease in young women in
the U.S. appear to be increasing [6]. Analysis of U.S. vital statistics
data showed that the coronary heart disease mortality rate for
women age 35­44 increased on average 1.3% per year from
1997­2002; this was the only subpopulation for which the rate had
increased,[6] suggesting the need for further study of risk factors in
this group.
Equally important, hypertension, estimated to complicate up to
5% of the estimated 4 million pregnancies in the United States
each year,[7] is a major source of maternal and fetal morbidity
[7,8]. Between 10 to 25% of women with chronic hypertension
will develop superimposed preeclampsia [9,10,11]. The risk of
placental abruption is also substantially elevated, approaching 2%
in some series [9,10]. Life-threatening maternal outcomes,
including stroke [12,13,14], renal failure [12,14], pulmonary
edema [12,14], and death [12,14] are also significantly increased
in women with chronic hypertension. Adverse fetal outcomes
associated with chronic hypertension include preterm birth and
intrauterine growth restriction [10,11] and the perinatal mortality

rate in offspring of mothers with chronic hypertension is elevated
approximately 2 to 4-fold [11,14,15,16].
Understanding the epidemiology of hypertension in young
women may help clinicians identify important modifiable risk
factors and public health officials target interventions, which in
turn may improve pregnancy outcomes and prevent cardiovascu-
lar disease. There are no recent nationwide data focusing on the
epidemiology of hypertension in this important group. The
purpose of this study is (1) to examine prevalence of hypertension
in women of reproductive age, (2) to identify factors independently
associated with hypertension in this group, and (3) to analyze the
medications used to treat hypertension in this population utilizing
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999­2008.
Methods
NHANES is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey
designed to assess the health and nutritional status of the U.S.
civilian, non-institutionalized population. NHANES became a
continuous survey in 1999; data are released in 2-year cycles. All
NHANES surveys include a personal interview in the household
and a detailed physical examination in a mobile examination
center (MEC). Additional data on the survey design, question-
naires, and laboratory methods are available elsewhere. (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health
Statistics. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm. Accessed
May 9, 2011.).
To reliably estimate prevalence of hypertension and anti-
hypertensive medication use among women of reproductive age,
data were analyzed from 5 survey periods collected from 1999 to
2008. The overall examination survey response rates ranged from
75% to 80%. During 1999­2008, 5,909 women aged 20­44
participated in the household and MEC examination. Among
those, 5,521 participants had complete data to determine
hypertension status and medication usage.
Hypertension was defined using blood pressure measurements
and/or self-reported anti-hypertensive use. Blood pressure was
measured by a physician using an appropriately sized cuff.
Volunteers rested at least 5 minutes before the blood pressure
readings were obtained. The average of up to 3 blood pressure
measurements, obtained during the MEC examination, was used
to assess blood pressure. Participants with an average systolic
blood pressure $140 mmHg and/or an average diastolic blood
pressure $90 mmHg or those who self-reported currently taking
prescribed medication for high blood pressure were defined as
hypertensive [17].
Prescription medication for respondents was obtained from the
prescription medication section of the household interview.
Participants were asked whether they had taken any prescription
medications in the previous 30 days. Interviewers recorded
prescriptions using their medication bottles. Medications recorded
by NHANES are coded and classified using the Lexicon PlusH
database. (Cerner, Multum, Inc. Available at: http://www.
multum.com/Lexicon.htm. Accessed: May 9, 2011.) Anti-hyper-
tensives were defined as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs), antiadre-
nergic agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and
diuretics. Combination drugs were re-categorized into the single
medication classes for each of the constituents of the combination
(i.e., each constituent was counted towards the total number
exposed for the class of the components). For those taking more
than one medication, each medication was separately counted
towards the total for each class. Prescription medication was only
examined among those who self-reported taking anti-hyperten-
sives.
For each participant, potential risk factors for hypertension were
abstracted from the dataset. These included age (grouped into 20­
34, 35­39, and 40­44 years old) and race/ethnicity (grouped into
white (non-Hispanic), black (non-Hispanic), Mexican-American,
and other), diabetes mellitus (defined as self-reported disease),
chronic kidney disease (defined as self-reported disease or a
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 15­60 mL/min per 1.73 m2,
with GFR calculated as previously described [18] ), average

.1 drink/day), active cigarette smoking, self-reported oral con-
traceptive use, and body mass index (BMI) (obtained from height
and weight measurement during the exam using standardized
techniques and equipment [19] and grouped as ,25 kg/m2, 25-
,30 kg/m2, 30-,35 kg/m2, and $35 kg/m2). The prevalence of
hypertension in each of these groups and the univariate association
of these variables and hypertension was determined. All variables
were then entered into a logistic regression model to identify
independent associations with hypertension. Logistic regression
was also used to assess for changes in the prevalence of
hypertension during the study period, comparing the prevalence
in1999­2000 with each subsequent two-year study interval.
To account for the complex, multistage probably survey design,
analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.2) callable
SUDAAN (release 10.0). Results are described as weighted
prevalence and unadjusted and adjusted weighted odds ratios.
Statistical significance was defined as an alpha level ,0.05.
Results
Using NHANES from 1999­2008, we identified 5,521 women
age 20­44 years old from whom blood pressure measurements
were obtained. The baseline characteristics of this group are
shown in Table 1. About 65% of the cohort were non-Hispanic
whites, 13% non-Hispanic blacks and 10% Mexican-Americans.
The estimated prevalence of diabetes was 2.4% and of chronic
kidney disease was 2.9%. Approximately 25% were cigarette
smokers, 24% drank on average more than one alcoholic drink
each day, and 19% reported using birth control pills. Only 42%
were of normal weight or lower; 26% were overweight, 16% had
class I obesity (BMI 30­35 kg/m2), and 15% had class II or III
obesity (BMI$35 kg/m2). The prevalence of hypertension was
relatively stable across the study period allowing for the
examination of the aggregate data for all 5 survey cycles. The
overall estimated prevalence of hypertension was 7.7% (95%
confidence interval (CI): 6.9%­8.5%).
Table 2 shows the prevalence of hypertension by demographics
and comorbidities and the univariate association of each of these
characteristics with hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension
increased significantly with age, from 2.7% in women age 20­34
to 18.4% in women age 40­44. Non-Hispanic blacks were more
than twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to have hypertension.
Other patient characteristics associated with hypertension includ-
ed diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and higher BMI. Self-reported
oral contraceptive (OCP) use was inversely associated in the
univariate analysis; however, the association attenuated after
adjusting for age since OCP use was inversely correlated with age
(compared to 20­34 year olds, the odds ratio for OCP use was
0.93 for 35­39 year olds and 0.32 for 40­44 year olds). The results
of a multivariate logistic regression analysis, with all variables
entered into the model, are also shown in Table 2.
Because increasing BMI was the most significant modifiable risk
factor identified in our analysis, we explored the relationship of
BMI and hypertension in more detail(Figure 1). There was a near
linear increase in the prevalence of hypertension with rising BMI
from 25. As shown in Figure 2, more than a quarter of all Black,
non-Hispanic women had stage II or greater obesity. Blacks had
higher prevalence of hypertension at every BMI compared with
whites; blacks with a BMI greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2 had a
prevalence of 26.5%.
In this study, 4.2% (95% CI 3.5%­4.9%) of women of
reproductive age used anti-hypertensive pharmacologic therapy.
Table 3 shows the distribution of the anti-hypertensive used by
patients reporting treatment for hypertension. Among anti-
hypertensive users, the most commonly used medication classes
included diuretics (47.9%), ACEIs (44.0%), and beta-blockers
(23.3%). For women taking ACEIs and/or ARBs, the prevalence
of diabetes was 19.2% (95% CI 13.0­27.4).
Discussion
This study uses data from the NHANES 1999 to 2008 sample to
define the prevalence and risk factors for hypertension for women
of reproductive age in the United States, and to describe the
relative prevalence of the medications used to treat hypertension in
this group. We report an overall hypertension prevalence of 7.7%,
which was relatively stable across the 10-year study period.
Advancing age, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, diabetes,
chronic kidney disease, and obesity were independently associated
with hypertension in this population. An estimated 4.9% of
women of reproductive age used antihypertensive pharmacologic
therapy. Among anti-hypertensive users, the most common
medication classes included diuretics (47.9%), ACE inhibitors
(44.0%), and beta blockers (23.3%).
The most significant modifiable risk factor for hypertension that
we identified in our analysis was obesity. After adjustment for
other variables, women with class I obesity were approximately 4-
fold and women with class II/III obesity approximately 6-fold
more likely to be hypertensive than their normal weight
counterparts. As shown in Figure 1, we also observed that the
prevalence of hypertension increased in a near linear fashion with
BMI and only started to plateau as BMI approached 40. The
rising prevalence of obesity in pregnancy,[20] suggests obstetri-

cians will be increasingly confronted with the issues of hyperten-
sion.
Non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity and advancing age were
non-modifiable patient characteristics associated with increased
risk for hypertension. Multiple studies in the general population
have demonstrated that hypertension in blacks is more prevalent,
earlier in onset, and more severe [21,22]. Hypertension, in part,
contributes to the large disparities between white and blacks in the
US in rates of cardiovascular disease [23] and adverse pregnancy
outcomes [24]. Developing preventive measures for hypertension
aimed at this group may be one mechanism to help decrease these
disparities. It should be noted that nearly one-half of young black
women were obese in this sample; preventative measures might
consider targeting obesity in this population.
The increased prevalence of hypertension with advanced age,
likewise, may explain some of the increased risk for some
pregnancy complications in women of advanced maternal age.
The problem of chronic hypertension in pregnancy is likely to
become more common as the numbers of mothers of advanced
age increases [25].
Approximately 5% of women of reproductive age took
antihypertensive medications. Most common among these were
diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta blockers. Recent data
regarding the risks of congenital malformations associated with
antihypertensive exposure during the first trimester have been
mixed, with some studies reporting increased risk while others
suggest that any observed risk is attributable to the underlying
hypertension (``confounding by indication'')
[26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. The Food and Drug Administration
currently categorizes most antihypertensives as category C­
meaning that animal studies either show an adverse effect or are
lacking and no well-controlled human studies exist, and that
medication should only be given when the benefit justifies the
potential risk to the fetus [33]. As about half of all pregnancies in
the United States are unintended [34], medications prescribed to
women of reproductive age are likely to be frequently taken during
the first trimester. Given the high prevalence of antihypertensive
medication utilization in women of reproductive age, further
research into the safety of these medications in pregnancy is
merited to inform the selection of the safest antihypertensive for
this population.
We found a relatively stable rate of hypertension across the
study period. Data suggest that the rate of obesity in the U.S. has
begun to plateau [19]. As shown in our study, obesity is an
extremely important risk factor for hypertension in this population,
and the lack of rise in obesity rates may explain the lack of rise in
the prevalence of hypertension.
Results reported in this study should be interpreted with the
following limitations in mind. First, there are several patient
characteristics that are known to be associated with hypertension
from previous studies, including heavy alcohol use [35], OCPs use
[36,37,38], and cigarette smoking [39], which were not significant
in our analysis of the NHANES sample. It may be that the effect of
alcohol and smoking in contributing to hypertension occurs only
after many years of exposure and thus the association is less robust
in young women, such as those considered in our study or that
some women with hypertension avoid tobacco and alcohol. In this
study, OCP use in the univariate analysis was protective; however,
OCP use was inversely correlated with advancing age, and after
adjustment for this and other patient characteristics, OCP use was
not significantly associated with hypertension. It is also likely that
clinicians are reluctant to prescribe OCP to hypertensive women
or discontinue OCPs if women develop hypertension, which would
lead to a lack of association or even an inverse association. An
additional limitation is that the lower age limit considered is 20 (as
certain variables of interest are not reported in the NHANES for
younger women). Likewise, in keeping with most epidemiologic
studies of women of reproductive age, we defined the upper age
limit for our population at 44­but women older than this can
become pregnant through assisted reproduction, and hypertension
is likely even more prevalent in this group. We were not able to
analyze the effect of physical activity on the risk of hypertension, as
the questions used to ascertain activity changed during the study
period. Finally, NHANES is a cross-sectional study and it is
appropriate for describing prevalence of conditions and associa-
tions, but not temporal relationships. As with any observational
study, it has a limited role in establishing causality.
In conclusion, hypertension occurs in about 8% of women of
reproductive age. Obesity is a risk factor of particular importance
in this population because it affects over 30% of young women in
the U.S., is associated with more than a 4 fold increased risk of
hypertension, and is potentially modifiable. There are also
remarkable differences in the prevalence of hypertension between
racial/ethnic groups. Women of reproductive age are commonly
exposed to antihypertensive medications and data regarding the
fetal risks associated with first trimester exposure are conflicting; as
a large proportion of pregnancies are unplanned, further work is
needed to define the safest antihypertensive medications for these
patients.
