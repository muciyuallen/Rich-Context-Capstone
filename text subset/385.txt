ABSTRACT
Background: Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC),
and the waist-stature ratio (WSR) are considered to be possible
proxies for adiposity.
Objective: The objective was to investigate the relations between
BMI, WC, WSR, and percentage body fat (measured by dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry) in adults in a large nationally representative
US population sample from the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES).
Design: BMI, WC, and WSR were compared with percentage body
fat in a sample of 12,901 adults.
Results: WC, WSR, and BMI were significantly more correlated
with each other than with percentage body fat (P , 0.0001 for all
sex-age groups). Percentage body fat tended to be significantly more
correlated with WC than with BMI in men but significantly more
correlated with BMI than with WC in women (P , 0.0001 except in
the oldest age group). WSR tended to be slightly more correlated
with percentage body fat than was WC. Percentile values of BMI,
WC, and WSR are shown that correspond to percentiles of percent-
age body fat increments of 5 percentage points. More than 90% of
the sample could be categorized to within one category of percent-
age body fat by each measure.
Conclusions: BMI, WC, and WSR perform similarly as indicators
of body fatness and are more closely related to each other than with
percentage body fat. These variables may be an inaccurate measure
of percentage body fat for an individual, but they correspond fairly
well overall with percentage body fat within sex-age groups and
distinguish categories of percentage body fat. Am J Clin Nutr

INTRODUCTION
Epidemiologic studies commonly use body mass index (BMI),
calculated from weight and height [weight (kg)/height2 (m)], as
an indicator of overweight and obesity. US and international
definitions of overweight and obesity for adults are based on
BMI (1, 2). Weight and height can be measured relatively
simply and accurately.
BMI is a measure of weight adjusted for height and does not
measure body composition directly. Obesity refers to an excess of
body fat. The underlying assumption of using BMI to define
obesity is that at a given height, higher weight is associated with
increased fatness (3). However, BMI is an imperfect measure of
body fatness (4, 5), largely because it does not directly measure
fat mass. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is one of the
most accurate and precise methods available to directly measure
total body fat and lean soft tissue mass, but it requires special-
ized DXA systems and X-ray exposure. Partly because of the
limitations of BMI, the use of other simple measures to evaluate
adiposity, such as waist circumference (WC) or the waist-stature
ratio (WSR), has also been suggested (6­8).
The objective of this study was to investigate the relations
between BMI, WC, WSR, and percentage body fat (from DXA)
in adults in a large nationally representative US population sample
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES). We compare these measures with each other. We
also estimate the percentile values of BMI, WC, and WSR that
approximately correspond to specified values of percentage body
fat.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
In NHANES, a representative cross-sectional sample of the US
civilian, noninstitutionalized population was selected by using
a complex, multistage probability design. Beginning in 1999,
NHANES is a continuous survey that includes an interview in the
household followed by an examination in a mobile examination
center. Adolescents aged 12­19 y, persons aged !60 y, blacks,
and Mexican Americans were oversampled to produce more
precise estimates for these groups. Data from NHANES 1999­
2004 were used. NHANES 1999­2004 underwent institutional
review board approval and included written informed consent.

Age was calculated in years at the time of the interview and
was grouped for analysis as 20­39, 40­59, 60­79, and !80 y.
Race and ethnicity were self-reported, and, for the purposes of
this study, race-ethnicity groups were classified as non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, and ``other''
race-ethnicity. Weight, height (stature), and WC were measured
by using standardized techniques and equipment (9). WC was
measured just above the iliac crest. WSR was calculated as WC
(cm)/height (m).
Whole-body percentage body fat was calculated as total body
fat mass divided by total mass (from DXA) 3 100. Whole-body
DXA scans were acquired by using a Hologic QDR 4500A fan-
beam densitometer (Hologic Inc, Bedford, MA) (9). The scan for
each survey participant was reviewed and analyzed by the
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Department
of Radiology, using standard radiologic techniques and study-
specific protocols developed for NHANES. Hologic Discovery
software, version 12.1, was used to analyze the scans. Beyond
planned exclusions, a number of participants were missing valid
DXA data for a variety of reasons. The percentage of partic-
ipants with valid data decreased with increasing age, primarily
because of an increase in implants such as pacemakers, stents,
and hip replacements. These artifacts can affect the accuracy of
the DXA results. Metal appears as dense bone, and soft tissue
implants such as breast augmentation appear as additional lean
soft tissue mass. In addition, the proportion of participants with
valid data was lower at higher BMI levels, in part because of
truncal adiposity. The DXA scanner cannot penetrate much
thicker than 15 cm, after which the accuracy of segmenting the
bone is limited.
Our analyses used the 5 NHANES 1999­2004 DXA Multiple
Imputation Data Files as released by the National Center for
Health Statistics (10). In part because data were not missing
completely at random, missing DXA values were imputed in
these public-use data sets. Because missing DXA data were
related to age, BMI, weight, and height and possibly to other
characteristics, participants with missing data could no be
treated as a random subset of the original sample. Otherwise,
analytic results could be biased toward participants with the
least amount of missing data. Multiple imputation (11) was
carried out to allow analyses to reflect the additional variability
due to the use of imputed values for the missing data. With
multiple imputation, M (in this case, M ¼ 5) versions of the
imputed values are created randomly and independently under
the imputation model, resulting in M completed data sets. Each
data set is analyzed using the analysis that would be used with
complete data, and the M sets of results are combined, with the
variability across the M analyses measuring the additional var-
iability due to missing data.
The characteristics of the missing data and the imputation
process for the NHANES 1999­2004 DXA Multiple Imputation
Data Files are both described in detail in the technical docu-
mentation (12). Briefly, however, a sequential regression mul-
tivariate imputation procedure (13) was implemented separately
within 10 age-by-sex groups. A large number of predictors were
used, including the non-DXA variables analyzed in this article as
well as body measurements, indicators of health, variables on
diet and use of medications, blood test results, variables related
to the design of the NHANES sample, and other demographic,
socioeconomic, and geographic variables. In addition, the cor-
relations between DXA measurements for different parts of the
body were taken into account. Thus, when measurements were
observed for some parts but not for others, the observed mea-
surements were used to predict the missing values.
The information used in the imputation process helps to adjust
subsequent analyses for the fact that the persons with missing
DXA data are not a completely random subset of the original
NHANES sample. The multiple imputations help to reflect un-
certainty in relations between the missing DXA values and other
variables that are analyzed with them.
Analytic sample
This report uses data for participants aged !20 y. There were
12,936 nonpregnant participants in this age range who had
complete weight and height data. Of these participants, 3005
were missing some or all DXA data and 2970 had some or all
imputed DXA data for a final analytic sample size of 12,901
nonpregnant adult participants with both BMI data and per-
centage body fat data. Of these, 345 were missing data on WC,
so the analyses based on WC used data on 12,556 participants,
of whom 2678 had some or all imputed DXA data.
Statistical methods
We calculated sample-weighted Pearson correlation coef-
ficients between each pair of the variables percentage body fat,
BMI, WC, and WSR within each age-sex group. For purposes of
statistically testing differences between correlation coefficients,
these correlations were transformed by using Fisher's z trans-
formation. For each imputation data set, the within-imputation
component of variance for a difference between 2 transformed
correlation coefficients was computed by using a (stratified)
jackknife method leaving out one primary sample unit (PSU) at
a time (14). These variances were combined with a between-
imputation component of variance for the differences in the trans-
formed correlations over the 5 imputation data sets (11); t tests
were used to test for equality between 2 transformed correlations,
and the df was determined according to Barnard and Rubin (15).
Forty-seven df (number of PSUs 2 the number of sampling
strata) was used as the complete-data df in this determination.
Standard BMI categories are well established and widely used.
However, categories of percentage fat are not well standardized.
According to a World Health Organization expert committee,
``there is no agreement about cut-off points for the percentage
of body fat that constitutes obesity'' (16; p 420). Thus, we calcu-
lated the weighted prevalence, averaged over the multiply im-
puted data sets, of arbitrary categories of percentage body fat
within age and sex groups using arbitrary increments of 5 per-
centage points. Because the distribution of percentage body fat
differed considerably between men and women, the ranges
covered were different for men than for women. For descriptive
purposes, we estimated the age and sex-specific percentile val-
ues of BMI, WC, and WSR that would correspond to the per-
centage fat categories in the sense that they identify the same
percentiles and proportion of the distribution and thus produce
approximately the same prevalence estimates as the percentage
fat categories. We used these levels to create categories of BMI,
WC, and WSR that were prevalence-matched to the percentage
fat categories. The overall classification by age- and sex-specific

categories was evaluated by calculating the percentage of
the population that fell into the corresponding category by any
2 measures (exact agreement) and using separate logistic
regression to model the dependence of exact agreement between
each pair of measures on sex, age group, and race-ethnicity
group. We also calculated the percentage that agreed to within
one category. The BMI, WC, and WSR categories were de-
termined empirically to match the percentage fat categories.
This empirical determination was not taken into account in the
estimation of the SEs in our analysis involving the BMI, WC,
and WSR categories; therefore, these SEs were most likely
slightly underestimated.
Analyses were conducted with PC-SAS (version 9.1; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (version 9.03; Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). All statistical
analyses used sample weights and accounted for the sample
design and the multiple imputations. Estimates were averaged
over the 5 sets of imputations. Statistical significance was de-
termined based on a P value ,0.05 with Bonferroni adjustment.
RESULTS
Basic descriptive information about the analytic sample is
shown in Table 1. Differences in mean values between men and
women were tested by using a 2-sample t test for complex
survey data (14). Pearson correlations between percentage fat,
BMI, WC, and WSR are shown in Table 2 by sex and age group.
Correlations by race-ethnicity group within sex and age groups
were similar to those seen overall (data not shown). All corre-
lations were significantly greater than zero (P , 0.0001). For
men, the correlations between percentage fat and BMI ranged
from 0.789 (20­39 y of age) to 0.716 (!80 y of age). The
corresponding values for women were 0.839 and 0.724. For
comparisons between pairs of correlations, statistical signifi-
cance was based on a P value of 0.00045, which was equivalent
to a P value of , 0.05 after Bonferroni correction. For men,
percentage fat was significantly more highly correlated with WC
or with WSR than with BMI (P , 0.00001, except in the oldest
age group in which the differences were not statistically sig-
nificant). For women, percentage fat was significantly more
highly correlated with BMI than with WC (P , 0.00001), ex-
cept in the oldest age group in which the difference was not
statistically significant (P ¼ 0.037). For women, percentage fat
tended to be more highly correlated with BMI than with WSR
(P , 0.05), but the difference was statistically significant only
for women aged 40­59 y (P , 0.00001). WSR tended to be
slightly more correlated with percentage fat than was WC alone;
the differences were statistically significant only in the youngest
age group for both men (P , 0.0001) and women (P , 0.0001).
For both men and women and within each age group, WC and
BMI were significantly more highly correlated with each other
than either was with percentage fat (P , 0.00001 for all sex-age
groups). Similarly, WSR and BMI were significantly more
highly correlated with each other than either was with per-
centage fat (P , 0.00001 for all sex-age groups).
The distribution of percentage fat categories and the corre-
sponding values for BMI, WC, and WSR are shown by age group
in Table 3 for men and in Table 4 for women. We identified
cutoffs for BMI, WC, and WSR that corresponded to the same
percentiles of the distribution as did the percentage fat values
and thus were matched to percentage fat categories in the sense
that these cutoffs would categorize the same proportion of
people within each BMI or waist or WSR category as did the
corresponding percentage fat category, although not necessarily
the same individuals. For example, 1.9% of men aged 20­39 y
had percentage fat values !40; the corresponding BMI cutoff
of 43 shown in Table 3 identified the highest 1.8% of BMI values,
a WC cutoff of 136 cm or more identified the highest 2.0% of
WC values, and a WSR cutoff of 75 identified the highest 1.8%
of WSR values. Although the prevalence estimates could not
always be matched exactly, the cutoffs shown in Tables 3 and
4 are the closest rounded values, and generally the prevalences
matched within 1 percentage point or less. These values suggest
that, for men in the age group 20­39 y, cutoffs of a BMI of 25,
a WC of 90 cm, or a WSR of 51 represent approximately the
same percentile of their respective distributions as a percentage
fat cutoff of 25%. However, in the oldest age group, a percent-
age fat cutoff of 25 was equivalent to the same percentile as
a cutoff of a BMI of 22 or a WC of 89 cm. At higher values
of percentage fat, the range of BMI values corresponding to a
5-percentage-point increase in body fat was wider than at lower
values of percentage fat. For example, for men aged 20­39 y, the
range of BMIs corresponding to a range in percentage body fat
from 20 to ,25% was 23 to ,25, but the range of BMI values
corresponding to a range in percentage body fat from 35% to
40% was wider, 35 to ,43. Similar results were observed for
WC and WSR as well.
We applied the age- and sex-specific cutoffs shown in Tables
3 and 4 to create BMI, WC, and WSR categories corresponding
to the prevalence of the percentage fat categories shown in Tables
3 and 4. Thus, all 4 sets of categories (percentage fat categories,
BMI categories, WC categories, and WSR categories) represent
similar estimated prevalences within each age-sex group. We
then assessed the agreement between percentage fat, BMI, WC,
and WSR categories by calculating the percentage of the population
that fell into the corresponding categories by 2 different

measures and also the percentage that agreed to within one
category by 2 different measures. For example, a woman in the
age range 20­39 y with an estimated percentage body fat of 35%
and a BMI of 23 would fall into corresponding categories by
these 2 measures, as shown in Table 4. However, if the BMI was
22, the woman would fall into a lower BMI category and thus be
considered to fall into different categories by these 2 measures,
but to agree within one category. The results for exact agreement
and agreement to within one category are presented in Table 5.
Overall, 46% of men and 49% of women were in the same
category by percentage fat and by BMI. Results for the agreement
of WC categories with percentage body fat categories were similar
tothose for the agreement ofBMI categories withpercentage body
fat categories, with estimates slightly higher for men (51%
agreement of WC categories with percentage body fat categories
compared with 46% agreement of BMI categories with percentage
body fat categories; P , 0.00002 for the difference) and slightly
lower for women (42% agreement of WC categories with per-
centage body fat categories compared with 49% agreement of
BMI categories with percentage body fat categories; P , 0.00001
for the difference). Estimates of agreement for WSR with per-
centage body fat were similar to those for WC and differences
between estimates of agreement with percentage body fat for WC
and estimates of agreement with percentage body fat for WSR
were not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.23 for the difference for
men and P ¼ 0.43 for women) As was also seen for the correlation

coefficients, BMI categories and WC categories or WSR catego-
ries showed better agreement with each other than either did with
percentage fat categories (P , 0.0001). For men, the percentage
who agreed in classification to within one category ranged from
93% to 100% across all measures. For women, the range was
slightly lower, from 91% to 100%. Approximately 33% of the
respondents [34.7% of men (95% CI: 33.3, 36.0) and 30.0% of
women (95% CI: 28.5, 31.5)] fell into the same category by
3 measures: percentage fat, BMI, and WSR.
As examples, more detailed information on the distribution of
agreement, based on the cutoffs in Tables 3 and 4, is shown
graphically for non-Hispanic white men aged 20­39 y (Figure
1) and for non-Hispanic white women aged 20­39 y (Figure 2).
These figures show the proportion of the sample in the indicated
percentage fat categories; within each percentage fat category,
they show the proportion of the total sample that are in the same
BMI category, or one category lower or higher, or 2 or more
categories lower or higher. Thus, for example, in Figure 1,
30.6% of the men in this subgroup fell into the percentage fat
category of 25 to ,30%. Slightly more than 50% of these men
(17.6% of the men in this subgroup) fell into the corresponding
BMI category, 5.7% fell into the next higher BMI category,
0.1% fell into !2 higher BMI categories, 5.3% fell into the next
lower BMI category, and 1.8% fell into !2 BMI categories
lower. The corresponding values for WSR categories were
18.9% (same), 5.9% (one higher), 0.1% (!2 higher), 4.9% (one
lower), and 0.8% (!2 lower).
In sex-specific logistic models adjusted for age group and race-
ethnic group, both the agreement of BMI categories with per-
centage fat (P ¼ 0.0004 for men, P ¼ 0.0623 for women) and the
agreement of WC categories with percentage fat (P ¼ 0.0016
for men, P ¼ 0.0518 for women) tended to vary significantly by
race-ethnicity categories. For both men and women, the agree-
ment of BMI categories with percentage fat categories was

significantly lower for non-Hispanic black men (odds ratio: 0.76;
95% CI: 0.65, 0.90) and women (odds ratio: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70,
0.94) than for non-Hispanic whites. For WC categories, the
agreement also tended to be lower for non-Hispanic blacks than
for non-Hispanic whites, although this was statistically significant
only for women (odds ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.96) and not for
men (odds ratio: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.02). For the WSR cate-
gories, there were no significant differences between race-
ethnicity groups for men (odds ratio: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.19) or
for women (odds ratio: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.11). Agreement
for Mexican Americans did not differ significantly from non-
Hispanic whites in any analyses. Because of the tendency for
agreement to be significantly lower for non-Hispanic blacks than
for other race-ethnicity groups, specific cutoffs for BMI and
WC for non-Hispanic black men and women are shown in Table 6
and Table 7, respectively. For example, the data in this table show
that among non-Hispanic black men aged 20­39 y, a BMI of 27
to ,32 corresponds more closely to the percentage fat category of
25 to ,30% than does the overall BMI range of 25 to ,30 shown
in Table 3, which suggests that at a given BMI, percentage fat is
somewhat lower in non-Hispanic blacks than in the full sample
or in non-Hispanic whites.
DISCUSSION
In this large population-based, nationally representative
sample, WC, WSR, BMI, and DXA-derived percentage body fat
were all highly correlated with each other within sex-age groups.
BMI, WC, and WSR all performed very similarly as indirect
measures of body fat, and they were more closely related to each
other than with percentage body fat. Percentage fat tended to be
slightly but significantly more correlated with WC than with BMI
among men, but significantly more correlated with BMI than with
WC among women; the differences were slight. Generally,
similar correlations of BMI with percentage body fat have been
found in other studies (17­22). Others (19, 23) have also found
that WC is slightly more correlated with fat than was BMI
among men but slightly less so among women.
We estimated values of BMI, WC, and WSR that identified the
same percentiles of the distribution as did arbitrary percentage
body fat categories and thus identified the same proportion of
the population. Approximately 40­50% of respondents were
classified into equivalent categories of WC, WSR, or BMI,
and .90% were classified similarly to within one category. The
purpose of presenting these values is to describe the distributions
of these variables and not to propose that these cutoff values be
used for categorization. Further research is needed to show how
best to use BMI, WC, or WSR to classify individuals according to
percentage fat. However, the relatively good agreement between
these variables suggests that BMI, WC, and WSR may serve well
in classifying individuals into broad categories corresponding to
percentage fat categories. Agreement in classification by WC or
WSR relative to BMI was higher, in the range of 60­70%.
In .90% of cases, and often in 99% or 100% of cases, classi-
fications differed by only one category.

As shown previously (17, 18), and as would be expected from
considerations of body composition (24, 25), percentage fat does
not increase linearly with body weight. Thus, a given difference
in BMI, WC, or WSR at low levels reflects a larger change in
percentage fat than does the same difference in BMI, WC, or
WSR at high levels.
BMI is widely used in epidemiologic studies to assess the risks
of health outcomes associated with different levels of body
weight. Some studies have suggested that WC, either singly or in
combination with BMI, may have a stronger relation to some
health outcomes than BMI alone (6, 26­28). In the NHANES
data, both BMI and WC had a similar relation to percentage body
fat and both were more highly correlated with each other than
with percentage body fat. It is not clear whether percentage
body fat is the most relevant variable in terms of relation of body
composition with health outcomes; some other aspect of body
composition such as lean mass or visceral adipose tissue might be
equally or more important. Bosy-Westphal et al (23) found that,
for practical purposes at the population level, BMI, WC, and
percentage fat all predicted metabolic risk factors equally well.
Similar findings have been reported by Dalton et al (29). Vazquez
et al (30) found that BMI and WC performed equally well in
predicting incident diabetes. Shen et al (31) found that WC was
more highly related to health risk factors than was percentage
body fat. Although WC has been suggested to be a better
measure of visceral adipose tissue (32), some evidence suggests
that it may also primarily be related to total body fat rather than
to visceral adiposity per se (33). Different health outcomes may
have different relations to body composition and to these various
highly correlated measures, so that the results may vary de-
pending on the outcomes examined and on other characteristics
of the study samples.
WSR has been suggested to be a better indicator of adiposity
than WC alone (7, 8). In the NHANES data, WSR tended to be
a slightly better indicator of percentage fat than was WC alone,
although the differences were not large. The cutoff value of 50
for WSR, suggested by Ashwell and Hsieh (8), is close to the
percentile that corresponds to percentage of 25% for men or of
35% for women; differences could arise in part from measuring
WC at a different anatomic location.
Other approaches have been taken to finding values of per-
centage fat comparable with BMI categories from samples with
both weight and height measures and body fat measures. Norgan
and Ferro-Luzzi (34) used prediction equations to predict per-
centage body fat (estimated from underwater weighing) at dif-
ferent BMI levels for men and found cutoff values of 15%, 22%,
29%, and 42% corresponding to BMI values of 20, 25, 30, and
40--roughly similar to our estimates. Several studies have used

receiver operating characteristic curves to assess different an-
thropometric measures relative to percentage body fat (5, 17, 35).
That approach, however, requires specifying a fixed percentage
body fat as the outcome; at present, there are no standard or widely
accepted categories of percentage body fat, as evidenced in part
by the fact that each of these articles used different cutoffs.
The relation of BMI to percentage fat varies by sex, age, and
race-ethnicity group (22, 36), so that the percentage fat that
a given BMI represents will tend to vary across sex, age, and
race-ethnicity. Considerable discussion has addressed the public
health and policy issues of using different BMI cutoffs for dif-
ferent ethnicity groups that have different relations of BMI to
body fat and to health risks (36­45). Our findings confirm that
the same BMI categories are associated with lower levels of
body fat in non-Hispanic blacks than in other race-ethnic groups
(36, 46, 47) and indicate that this is also the case for WC. Other
research has also suggested that the health risks associated with
a given BMI level may be lower for blacks than for whites (44,
46, 48­51). In general, the selection of BMI cutoffs is related to
health outcomes, but the method used to establish exact cutoffs
has been called ``largely arbitrary'' (16). The BMI, WC, or WSR
cutoffs that identify similar levels of body fat across age, sex,
and ethnicity groups may differ from the BMI, WC, or WSR
cutoffs that identify similar levels of health risk across age, sex,
and ethnicity groups.
Our study had some limitations. Percentage fat was based only
on DXA measurements, not on more complex body-composition
models such as a 4-compartment model (52­56). WC was mea-
sured just above the iliac crest, and this may limit the compara-
bility of our results with WC measured in other anatomic locations
(57). Multiple imputation methods were used to adjust for missing
DXA data. As with any method that adjusts analyses for missing
data, the validity of results depends on the validity of the as-
sumptions about the missing data.
The results presented herein show the values of BMI, WC, and
WSR that will divide the population into categories prevalence-
matched to those identified by the percentage body fat categories.
These are presented for descriptive purposes and not as a pro-
posed approach to use in categorizing these variables. However,
they may assist in showing the distributions of BMI, WC, and
WSR relative to the distribution of percentage fat. These values
vary by age, sex, and to some extent by race-ethnicity group. In
general, BMI, WC, WSR, and percentage body fat are all closely
related, and, as percentage body fat increases, BMI, WC, and
WSR all increase. BMI and WC or WSR showed somewhat
higher agreement with each other than either did with percentage
fat. For men, WC and WSR agreed slightly better than did BMI
with categories of percentage fat. For women, however, BMI
agreed with categories of percentage fat better than did WC or
WSR. Although an estimate of body fat based on BMI, WC, or
WSR for an individual may be inaccurate, overall BMI, WC, and
WSR values correspond fairly well within groups and distinguish
categories of body fatness.
