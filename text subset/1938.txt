The association of psychosocial stress with weight gain may have important implications for clinical practice and
workplace and public health interventions. To determine whether multiple domains of psychosocial stress were
associated with weight gain from 1995 to 2004, the authors analyzed a nationally representative longitudinal cohort
of 1,355 men and women in the United States. Change in body mass index was assessed for multiple domains of
psychosocial stress related to work, personal relationships, life constraints, and finances, controlling for other
factors associated with weight gain. All analyses were stratified by sex and weighted to account for the complex
survey design. Among men with high baseline body mass index, weight gain was associated with increasing levels
of psychosocial stress related to job-related demands (P < 0.001 for interaction with baseline body mass index),
lack of skill discretion (P ¼ 0.014), lack of decision authority (P ¼ 0.026), and difficulty paying bills (P ¼ 0.004).
Among women with high baseline body mass index, weight gain was associated with job-related demands
(P < 0.001 for interaction with baseline body mass index), perceived constraints in life (P < 0.001), strain in
relations with family (P ¼ 0.016), and difficulty paying bills (P ¼ 0.010). Interventions to address psychosocial
stress may limit weight gain among overweight and obese men and women.

Psychosocial stress has been implicated as a risk factor
for high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and cancer
(1­7). The association between stress and long-term weight
gain is less clear. Stress may contribute to changes in dietary
behaviors that lead to weight change, with various effects
related to sex (8­10), baseline body mass index (11), or
cortisol reactivity in response to stress (12, 13). These fac-
tors may cause some people to gain more weight under
stressful circumstances, while others may gain less weight
or even lose weight when stressed.
Cross-sectional studies have reported only weak associ-
ations between psychosocial stress and body mass index
(14). Three longitudinal cohort studies conducted in popu-
lations outside the United States have produced mixed re-
sults. Kivimaki et al. (11) used the Whitehall study,
a prospective cohort of British civil servants, to analyze
the prospective association between work stress and weight
change over 5 years. They found that greater job strain and
lesser job control at baseline were associated with weight
gain among men who were overweight or obese at baseline,
but a similar association was not observed among women.
Brunner et al. (15) completed an additional analysis of the
same cohort after further follow-up. They reported that men
with chronic job strain, coupled with low social support
among co-workers, were more likely to develop obesity
(body mass index, !30 kg/m2) and central obesity (waist
circumference, >102 cm in men and >88 cm in women)
than those who had no job strain. In a Dutch cohort, Van
Strien et al. (16) showed that men who were ``emotional
eaters'' experienced weight gain over the 6 months after
a negative life event, such as death of a family member,
divorce or separation from a spouse, or financial difficulties.
Korkeila et al. (17) found an association between neuroti-
cism and weight gain among women over 6 years in a cohort
of Finnish twins, but this effect subsided after 15 years of
follow-up.

Based on this prior research, the objective of the current
study was to assess the association of weight gain with
numerous types of psychosocial stress related to work, per-
sonal relationships, life constraints, and finances over ap-
proximately 9 years in a nationally representative cohort of
adults in the United States. We hypothesized, on the basis of
prior research (11), that baseline body mass index would be
an effect modifier of the relation between psychosocial
stress and weight gain, and we tested for this effect in all
statistical models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study enrolled a
nationally representative cohort of noninstitutionalized
adults between the ages of 25 and 74 years in 1995 (www.
midus.wisc.edu). This study was designed to assess psycho-
social factors that influence physical and mental health for
adults in midlife. At enrollment, participants responded to
a telephone survey and self-administered questionnaire.
Households with telephones were sampled in the cotermi-
nous United States by random digit dialing. One English-
speaking adult was chosen at random in each participating
household, with oversampling of older adults and men.
The combined response rate at enrollment to telephone
and written questionnaires was 60.8% (70.0% of those who
were contacted and eligible for the telephone survey re-
sponded, and 86.8% of telephone respondents completed
the written questionnaire) (18). A similar telephone survey
and self-administered questionnaire were administered to
surviving participants in 2004. The study protocol was ap-
proved by the human studies committees of Harvard Med-
ical School and the University of Wisconsin, and all subjects
provided informed consent for participation in this study.
The analysis was restricted to 2,570 respondents <65
years of age at baseline because of limited weight change
in those aged !65 years. In this cohort, the response rate to
the follow-up survey was 60% (n ¼ 1,552) among surviving
adults. Nonrespondents to the follow-up survey had a similar
baseline mean body mass index when compared with re-
spondents (26.75 vs. 26.80 kg/m2; P ¼ 0.83). They also
had similar levels of baseline psychosocial stress, though
nonrespondents had slightly higher levels of perceived con-
straint in life (scale score, 2.76 vs. 2.64; P ¼ 0.020) and
strain in relations with spouse/partner (scale score, 2.31
vs. 2.23; P ¼ 0.009). Nonrespondents also were younger
(P < 0.001); more likely to be male (P < 0.001), unmar-
ried (P ¼ 0.015), or nonwhite (P < 0.001); more likely to
smoke (P < 0.001); and had lower incomes (P < 0.001)
and worse self-rated health (P < 0.001). All respondents
undergoing cancer treatment (n ¼ 42) and female respon-
dents who were pregnant (n ¼ 28) at baseline or follow-up
were excluded because of fluctuations in weight related to
these conditions. Another 127 subjects who were missing
a baseline or follow-up body mass index measurement were
excluded, yielding a final study cohort of 1,355 adults who
completed the follow-up survey an average of 9.2 years after
the baseline survey.
Study variables
The change in body mass index from 1995 to 2004 was
our outcome measure. Body mass index was calculated
from self-reported height and weight. A subset of 464 sub-
jects in our sample (34%) also had height and weight mea-
sured objectively in 2004. The Pearson correlation
coefficients between the self-reported and measured values
of body mass index for these subjects in 2004 were 0.93 in
men and 0.92 in women.
Our primary predictor variables were psychosocial stress
scales measured at baseline that assessed stress related to
work, personal relationships, life constraints, and finances
(Appendix). Three well-validated stress scales captured
work experiences related to skill discretion (3 items), de-
cision authority (6 items), and job-related demands (5 items)
(19, 20). These scales each had strong internal reliability,
with a Cronbach coefficient alpha ranging from 0.68 to 0.85
in our cohort. Other scales captured strain in relations with
spouse/partner (6 items: Cronbach alpha ¼ 0.81), friends
(4 items: alpha ¼ 0.79), or family (4 items: alpha ¼ 0.80)
(21). To evaluate stress from general life experiences, we
used a scale that evaluated perceived constraints in life (8
items: alpha ¼ 0.86) (22, 23). Financial stress was assessed
with a single question about difficulty paying bills.
Clinical and demographic covariates, selected a priori
from the baseline survey, included baseline body mass
index, medical conditions and health status (diabetes,
smoking, self-rated health, and relative self-rated health
compared with others the same age), self-reported race/
ethnicity, income, age, and psychiatric conditions (depres-
sion, generalized anxiety, and panic disorder as defined ac-
cording to psychiatric scales derived from the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition,
Appendix) (24, 25). Race/ethnicity was included in the anal-
ysis because of previously described racial and ethnic differ-
ences in body mass index in the United States (26). An
indicator variable for quitting smoking during the follow-
up period controlled for the likely associated weight gain.
All variables were entered into models as presented in Table
1 except for baseline body mass index, which was included
in the models after being centered on sex-specific mean
body mass index. The covariates had no missing data; psy-
chosocial stress scales had less than 1% missing except
for work-related stress scales, which had 6.7% missing.
Subjects with missing predictors were excluded from the
models assessing those predictors.
Statistical analysis
The psychosocial stress scales were constructed by cal-
culating the mean for all responses to items in a scale, coded
so that higher values represented greater psychosocial
stress. Analyses of work-related stress included only re-
spondents who were working at baseline. Analysis of
spouse- or partner-related stress included only respondents
who were married or living with a partner. All analyses were
stratified by sex, because of prior studies demonstrating that
the relation between stress and eating behaviors or weight
differs between men and women (8­11, 15­17, 27).

Data were weighted to adjust for probabilities of reaching
households within each telephone exchange, sampling
subjects within each household, and obtaining completed
telephone interviews and questionnaires from designated
subjects (28). Poststratification weights were calculated so
the cohort that completed both the baseline telephone in-
terview and written questionnaire approximated the distri-
bution of US adults aged 25­64 years by region, residence in
a metropolitan area, sex, race, age, education, and marital
status from the October 1995 Current Population Survey
(29).
Change in body mass index was regressed on each psy-
chosocial stress variable, controlling for the clinical and
demographic covariates listed above and for interactions
between baseline body mass index as a continuous variable
and the psychosocial stress scales as continuous variables.
These interactions assessed potential effect modification of
the association between psychosocial stress and weight gain
related to baseline body mass index. All beta coefficients are
unit dependent with units of kg/m2. To graphically present
the interaction effects for those variables found to have
significant interactions, trend lines were graphed to repre-
sent predictions from the fitted model for specified baseline
body mass index values, set to the mean for the body mass
index categories of normal weight (<25 kg/m2), overweight
(25­29.9 kg/m2), and obesity (!30 kg/m2). We report other
covariates if they were significantly associated with a change
in body mass index in more than half of the final sex-
stratified models.
All analyses were conducted with SAS, version 9.1, sta-
tistical software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina)
to account for the complex survey design. Two-tailed
P values are reported for all analyses.
RESULTS
Weighted descriptive characteristics of the study cohort at
baseline are presented in Table 1. Women had higher levels
of baseline psychosocial stress than men in several domains:
less skill discretion (P ¼ 0.004), less decision authority
(P < 0.001), more perceived constraints in life (P <
0.001), and more strain in relationships with family (P <
0.001) (Table 2). Psychosocial stress levels measured at base-
line and follow-up were moderately correlated for each
stress scale (Pearson correlations: 0.43­0.55 for men and
0.41­0.57 for women). Women had lower mean baseline
body mass index than men (26.29 vs. 27.49 kg/m2;
P < 0.001). The change in body mass index over the mean
follow-up period of 9.2 years was similar in women and men
(1.57 vs. 1.37 kg/m2; P ¼ 0.33).
In multivariable models including all covariates and an
interaction term between baseline body mass index and each
respective psychosocial stress scale, numerous significant
associations for psychosocial stress emerged (Table 3).
When interactions were significant, greater psychosocial
stress was associated with greater weight gain as baseline
body mass index increased (P < 0.05 for interaction term).
This effect was evident for financial stress for both men
and women, for all work-related stress variables (less skill
discretion, less decision authority, and higher job-related
demands) for men, and for job-related demands, perceived
constraints in life, and strain in relationships with family
for women. Figures 1­4 portray the significant relations
between psychosocial stress and change in body mass index
for selected baseline body mass indexes that correspond to

the mean body mass index of 3 weight categories (normal
weight, overweight, and obesity).
Several other covariates also significantly predicted a
change in body mass index in at least half of the sex-stratified
models. Men and women who were aged 55­64 years at
enrollment experienced less weight gain compared with
the youngest age group. Among women, increasing baseline
body mass index was associated with less weight gain, and
quitting smoking was associated with more weight gain.
Generalized anxiety and an income between $25,000 and
$44,999 were associated with more weight gain for men.
Because generalized anxiety was a significant predictor of
more weight gain for men in the base models, we fitted
additional models without the psychosocial stress scales
and included interaction terms between the presence of each
psychiatric condition and baseline body mass index (in
3 separate models for depression, generalized anxiety dis-
order, and panic disorder for both men and women). De-
pression and generalized anxiety were highly correlated
within each sex (P < 0.01), and both conditions were sig-
nificantly associated with more weight gain among women
and men at higher levels of baseline body mass index. There
was no significant association of panic disorder with change
in body mass index for either men or women.
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative cohort of US adults fol-
lowed longitudinally over 9 years, psychosocial stress was
associated with greater weight gain among both men and
women with higher baseline body mass indexes if they ex-
perienced job-related demands, had difficulty paying bills,
or had depression or generalized anxiety disorder. Among
women with higher baseline body mass indexes, perceived
constraints in life and strain in relations with family also
were associated with greater weight gain. Among men with
higher baseline body mass indexes, lack of skill discretion
or decision authority at work was associated with greater
weight gain.
These findings extend prior cross-sectional and longitudi-
nal research by providing an expanded view of associations
between psychosocial stress and weight gain in a nationally
representative cohort of adults in the United States. Several
studies have demonstrated heterogeneity in eating behaviors
in response to stress; some people eat more when stressed
while others eat less (30­32). Laboratory and observational
studies of stress and eating behavior have shown inconsistent
results when stratified by baseline weight (27). In our study,
with a long follow-up period and diverse measures of psy-
chosocial stress, subjects with higher body mass indexes at
baseline who reported greater psychosocial stress gained
more weight, whereas this pattern was not evident for those
with lower baseline body mass indexes.
Our results also highlight apparent sex differences in the
influence of stress on weight gain. Some stressors outside of
work or finances, including general life constraints and
strain in relationships with family, were associated with
weight gain among women but not among men, suggesting
effects on weight from a broader range of life domains in
women. Prior cross-sectional studies have shown some dif-
ferential effects by sex. These studies assessed fewer mea-
sures of stress than our study evaluated and provided only
limited information about specific types of stressors that
might differentially influence weight gain (14, 33, 34).
Analyses from the 3 prior longitudinal studies were strat-
ified by sex. In the Whitehall study of British civil servants,

models, but the association was no longer significant when
an interaction with baseline body mass index was included.
In the subsequent analysis of the same cohort, men with
chronically elevated levels of job strain and low social sup-
port at work were more likely to become obese and to de-
velop a high waist circumference than those with no job
strain (15); these associations were not significant among
women.
Van Strien et al. (16) prospectively evaluated the influence
of negative life events in a cohort in the Netherlands. Men
classified as highly ``emotional eaters'' gained weight for
up to 2 years after the occurrence of a negative life event.
No correlation was observed for women. In a large cohort
study of monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic Finnish
twins, Korkeila et al. (17) assessed associations of stress
and personality type at baseline with weight gain of greater
than 10 kg after follow-up of 6 years and 15 years. The
only significant adjusted associations were between neurot-
icism and weight gain after 6 years among older women
and between extroversion and less weight gain among
younger men.
Stress appears to influence eating behaviors differently by
sex as well. In a study of high school students aged 15­19
years, caloric consumption increased on days with stressful
events for girls but not for boys (though boys did increase
their fat intake) (9). Similarly, among college students,
women consumed more calories than men when exposed
to a stressful film (8).
Our study found an association between baseline depres-
sion and anxiety and weight gain among men and women
with higher baseline body mass indexes. Prior evidence has
linked depression with the development of obesity, specifi-
cally among children and adolescents (35­38). Investiga-
tions of the relation between anxiety and weight gain have
shown mixed results. Some studies have shown associations
between anxiety at baseline and weight gain among men

ward decreased likelihood of becoming overweight among
men and women with anxiety at baseline (40). None of these
studies of depression and anxiety have assessed the effect
modification of baseline body mass index.
Several pathways have been explored in animal models to
assess how psychosocial stress may influence weight gain.
Social subordination in several species of primates induces
chronically elevated cortisol levels, and high cortisol levels
are associated with abdominal obesity in both nonhuman
primates and humans (41­43). As a result, social subordi-
nation has been examined as a model for stress-induced
eating and weight gain. Female monkeys who are socially
subordinate have higher levels of abdominal obesity than
socially dominant females (44). In an observational study
of macaques, Wilson et al. (45) found that socially subordi-
nate females consumed more calories and fed more fre-
quently than socially dominant females. The subordinate
females also demonstrated more anxious behavior and had
alternations of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with less
negative feedback from elevated glucocorticoid levels. Lab-
oratory studies in rats have shown that mild stress (e.g., tail
pinching or restraint) can lead to weight gain if highly palat-
able foods are provided, but not with regular diets (46­48).
Based in large part on animal models, a complex interplay
of hormones such as glucocorticoids and ghrelin (that in-
crease appetite) and corticotrophin-releasing hormone and
leptin (that decrease appetite) has been proposed by other
researchers (48­51) to be involved in the physiologic path-
ways between stress and weight gain. Endogenous opiates
induced by eating might also serve a role in limiting the
dysphoric effects of stress (52). These pathways suggest
a ``comfort food'' or ``emotional eating'' paradigm that
has been proposed to explain stress-induced eating and
weight gain (53, 54). The influence of stress on weight gain,
therefore, may depend on the intensity and duration of stress
and the types of food that are available for consumption.
Few mechanistic studies have assessed hormonal path-
ways that could link stress and weight in humans. Normal-
weight women with major depression had more than twice
the cortisol level and intraabdominal fat as those without
depression (55). In a laboratory experiment with postmen-
opausal women subjected to a stress-inducing protocol, Epel
et al. (56) discovered that women with high waist/hip ratios,
regardless of body mass index, were more likely to display
higher stress-induced cortisol levels. Women with high
waist/hip ratios also felt more threatened under stress, and
controlling for this high threat appraisal partially attenuated
Figure 3. Adjusted change in body mass index from 1995 to 2004 for perceived constraint in life and strain in relations with family among US
women. Increasing perceived constraint in life (A) and increasing strain in relations with family (B) were associated with increasing weight gain
among obese women and less weight gain among normal weight women. Results were adjusted for baseline body mass index; age; race; income;
presence of generalized anxiety disorder, panic attack, or depression; smoking status; quitting smoking; presence of diabetes; self-rated health;
and self-rated relative health. Trend lines represent predictions from the fitted model for specified body mass index (BMI) values, set to the body
mass index mean for each baseline body mass index category: 21.7 (normal weight), 27.3 (overweight), and 35.4 (obese) kg/m2.

the association between waist/hip ratio and cortisol. Addi-
tional studies have documented higher snack food consump-
tion in women with high stress-induced cortisol levels
(12, 13).
Our study had several potential limitations. First, there
was only 1 follow-up measure of body mass index over
a mean of 9.2 years. Psychosocial stress could change over
this time period, though there was a moderately high degree
of correlation between baseline and follow-up psychosocial
stress. Second, although our study cohort was representa-
tive of US adults, the response rate to the follow-up survey
in our sample was 60%, and nonrespondents differed from
respondents on several demographic and health character-
istics. However, models were adjusted for the variables that
differed between respondents and nonrespondents, and fur-
ther bias would only arise if the relation of stress and
weight change also differed for these 2 groups. Third, cer-
tain medications can be associated with weight gain (57).
However, the MIDUS survey did not collect specific drug
names, so we could not control for active use of these
medications. Nonetheless, in all models, we controlled for
diabetes, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression, con-
ditions which are commonly treated with medications that
are associated with weight gain. The most commonly used
medications for depression and generalized anxiety disor-
der, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have mixed ef-
fects on weight, so the net effect of these medications on
weight gain may be limited (57). Fourth, causality cannot
be established in our data despite the temporal ordering of
baseline stress and subsequent weight gain. Fifth, weight
and height were self-reported in this study and thus could
be biased. Other studies have reported a high correlation
between self-reported weight and height and measured
body mass index (17, 58­60), and the prevalence of obesity
and overweight in our sample was consistent with reported
national estimates (26). Furthermore, in the subset of 464
subjects in our sample who had height and weight objec-
tively measured at follow-up, the correlation between self-
reported and measured body mass index in 2004 exceeded
0.92 for both men and women. Finally, the number of sig-
nificant interactions found (12 of 22 tested at the 0.05 level,
all in the same direction) exceeded what would be expected
by chance, and the pattern was consistent with prior
evidence.
In this nationally representative cohort, several domains
of psychosocial stress as well as anxiety and depression
were associated with weight gain among men and women
with higher body mass indexes. Awareness of these associ-
ations may enable clinicians to help their overweight and
obese patients avoid gaining further weight during stressful
periods. Stress reduction may also be an important compo-
nent of weight-loss interventions in worksites and in clinical
and public health programs (61­65).
