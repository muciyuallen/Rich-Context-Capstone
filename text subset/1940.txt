Abstract
Objectives: This study was to examine whether psychosocial work characteristics such as job control, psychological job
demands, and their combinations are associated with leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) in US workers. Materials and
Methods: 2019 workers (age range: 32 to 69) from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States
(MIDUS) II study (2004­2006) were chosen for this cross-sectional study. Job control and job demands were measured by
standard questionnaire items. Active LTPA was defined as "moderate or vigorous" level of physical activity. Results: After
controlling for covariates (e.g., age, race, education, income, physical effort at work, obesity, and alcohol consumption),
high job control was associated with active LTPA. Active jobs (high control and low demands) and low-strain jobs (high
control and high demands), compared to passive jobs (low control and low demands), increased the odds for active LTPA.
The associations varied by sex and education level. Job demands alone were not associated with active LTPA. Conclusions:
Having on-the-job learning opportunities and decision authority on their tasks may be conducive to active LTPA in middle-
aged US workers.

INTRODUCTION
Regular physical activity reduces the risk of all-cause
mortality, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure,
stroke, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, colon can-
cer, breast cancer, and depression [1,2]. Thus it has been
widely recommended as a key public health policy [1,3,4]
in the United States (US): for instance, adults should en-
gage in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical
activity (e.g., brisk walking) on five days of the week.
However, according to the recent statistics from the Be-
havioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) [5],
only half of US adults meet the recommended level
of physical activity and about 25% of adults do not en-
gage in any physical activity during their leisure time.
More importantly, the proportions have not changed

(e.g., reading books, sports activities, social participation,
and political activities), but in contrast, those who have
a "passive job" (a combination of low control and low
demands), would undergo a process of "skill atrophy and
unlearning" [10, p. 94]. This group would be least active
in the leisure activities. In addition, those who had "low
strain" jobs (a combination of high control and low de-
mands) or "high strain" jobs (a combination of low con-
trol and high demands) would have intermediate levels
of the leisure activities. In a national Swedish study [6],
sports activities during leisure time were more prevalent
in those who had high control, high demands, and an ac-
tive job (vs. passive job).
Other theories have focused on the internal process of how
people change behavior [11­13]. These theories posit that
for successful adoption of healthy behaviors, a person
needs to be highly motivated and also to have skill and
ability to actualize a well-conceived plan for the behavior
against barriers in reality.
In sum, the above theories imply that job control, psycho-
logical job demands, and an active job (vs. passive job)
would be associated with LTPA in a working population.
Empirical evidence:
psychosocial working conditions and active LTPA
Empirical evidence for these associations has been in-
conclusive. Some studies have supported the associations
for high job control [6,14­18], high psychological job
demands [6] and an active job [6,15,19]. But other stud-
ies have not supported the associations for high job con-
trol [12,20], high psychological job demands [12,14­18,20]
and an active job [14,21,22]. In addition, only a few stud-
ies [15,16,19,20,22] examined the associations after con-
trolling for possible confounders such as socioeconomic
status, physical effort at work, and working hours. Further-
more, to our knowledge, few studies [15] have examined
the associations in US workers from diverse occupations
and industries.
The aim of this study is to examine whether psychosocial
work characteristics are associated with active (moderate
or vigorous level) LTPA in middle-aged US workers, using
a recent US national dataset.
much during the last fifteen years. The reasons for this
situation are not well understood and there may well be
important unidentified social and environmental deter-
minants of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA). This
study explores the role of psychosocial work character-
istics such as job control, psychological job demands,
and their combinations as occupational determinants
of LTPA in US workers.
Theories: the relationship between work and LTPA
A number of sociologists [6­9] have postulated that work
characteristics could affect leisure-time activities of work-
ers and, generally, there would be a similarity rather
than an antithesis between work and non-work activities
(called "spill-over hypothesis" vs. "compensation hy-
pothesis"). Meissner [7] suggested, in a study on manual
workers at a Canadian wood-product manufacturing fac-
tory, that "the design of industrial work creates or pre-
vents opportunities for the development or maintenance
of discretionary and social skills. When choice of action is
suppressed by the spatial, temporal, and functional con-
straints of the work process, worker capacity for meeting
the demands of spare-time activities which require discre-
tion is reduced. They engage less in those activities which
necessitated planning, coordination, and purposeful ac-
tion" (p. 260). In the study, Meissner [7] reported that
those who had high job discretion engaged more frequent-
ly in sports activities during their leisure time, in contrast,
those who had low job discretion engaged more frequently
in sedentary activities at home (e.g., going for a drive, TV
watching) during their leisure time.
Karasek [6] also proposed a similar, but more sophisti-
cated hypothesis based on the two concepts -- job con-
trol (opportunities at work for learning and decision
making) and psychological job demands (degree of men-
tal work demands). According to the active-passive hy-
pothesis of the demand-control (DC) model [6,10], those
who have an "active job" (a combination of high control
and high demands) would develop "more skills through
the trial/failure/success learning process" [10, p. 93] and
an active personality ("feeling of mastery or confidence",
p. 98). Thus, they would be most active in leisure activities

gender. However, in the follow-up, less-educated per-
sons and non-whites were relatively more likely to have
dropped out of the study. For the MIDUS II study, 4963
persons (males, 47% and females, 53%) completed a tele-
phone interview only (N = 931) and both the interview
and mailed questionnaires (N = 4032). For this analysis,
we first restricted study subjects to those (N = 2292) who
completed both the interview and mailed questionnaires
(N = 4032), were not pregnant (N = 4954), were work-
ing a paid-job (at least one hour per week at a main job)
in the MIDUS II survey (N = 2469), and were aged less
than70years(N=4177).Finally2019workers(1001males
and 1018 females) who had valid information on the expo-
sure and outcome variables (see below) were chosen for
this analysis.
Main exposures -- job control, psychological job
demands, and their combinations
Both job control and psychological job demands were as-
sessed by self-administered questionnaire items, similar
to the ones of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) [24].
Job control was measured with five items about skill dis-
cretion (2 items; e.g., "How often do you learn new things
at work?") and decision authority (3 items; e.g., "How of-
ten do you have a choice in deciding how you do your tasks
at work?"). Psychological job demands were measured
with three items about work intensity, workload, and time
pressure (e.g., "How often do you have enough time to
get everything done?" -- reverse scored). More detailed
information about the items is available elsewhere [25].
The items had a five-point Likert type of response set: all
of the time (1) to never (5) and were summed up for scal-
ing-scoring. The Cronbach alphas of job control and psy-
chological job demands were 0.81 and 0.68, respectively.
For analysis, the two scale scores were divided into four
groups based on their quartiles. The lowest groups of job
control and psychological job demands scale scores were
chosen as the reference for analysis (see below).
The four quadrants of the DC model -- active, low strain,
high strain, and passive jobs -- were created by two differ-
ent methods: a) based on the medians of job control and
psychological job demands (hereafter called "four-group
METHODS
Study population
Data from the National Survey of Midlife Development
in the United States (MIDUS) II study [23] were used
for this study. Information on physical effort at work
and leisure-time physical activity was not available in
the MIDUS I study, so it was not possible to perform
a longitudinal analysis. From 1995 to 1996, the MacAr-
thur Midlife Research Network carried out a nation-
al survey (i.e., MIDUS I study) to investigate the role
of behavioral, psychological, and social factors in un-
derstanding age-related differences in physical and
mental health [23]. In the MIDUS I study, 7108 persons
(males, 48% and females, 52%) completed a telephone
interview only (N = 783) or both the interview and
mailed questionnaires (N = 6325). All of the participants
were non-institutionalized, English-speaking adults,
aged 25­74, in the US. They were drawn from four sub-
samples: (a) a national random-digit-dial (RDD) sample
(N = 3487); (b) oversamples from five metropolitan ar-
eas (N = 757); (c) siblings of individuals from the RDD
sample (N = 950); and (d) a national RDD sample
of twin pairs (N = 1914). The response rates of the four
subsamples ranged from 60% to 70%. The four subsam-
ples were very similar to one another in terms of the dis-
tributions of age, education, and gender [23]. The socio-
demographic characteristics of the RDD subsample were
comparable to those of a US population representative
sample, the October 1995 Current Population Survey
(http://www.census.gov/cps). However, the RDD sub-
sample relatively underrepresented those who were
black, young (e.g., aged 25 to 34), or had less education
(i.e., 12 or less than 12 years of formal education) [23].
A follow-up survey of the participants of the
MIDUS I study respondents was conducted from 2004
to 2006. The average follow-up interval was approximate-
ly 9 years later and ranged from 7.8 to 10.4 years. The lon-
gitudinal retention rates among the four subsamples
ranged from 65% to 78% (on average, 70%). There were
no significant (p < 0.01) differences between the follow-
up participants and non-participants in terms of age and

Covariates
Various potential covariates were considered in the analy-
sis: data sources, socio-demographic measures [4,27­31],
other working conditions [6,16,17,22,27,32,33], health
conditions [28,34], and health behaviors [28­30]. Spe-
cifically, four data sources: city; siblings; and twin sub-
samples (vs. the national random subsample), age (< 40;
40 to 49; 50 to 59; and  60 years old), sex, marital status
(married and non-married), race (whites vs. others), an-
nual household income (< $ 60 000; $ 60 000 to $ 99 999;
and  $100 000), and education (high -- university/gradu-
ate school graduate; middle -- some college education,
but unfinished; and low -- high school graduate and lower
education). Working conditions were measured by ques-
tionnaire items: physical effort at work (1 item), coworker
(2 items) and immediate supervisor (2 items) support,
and no coworkers (2 items) and immediate supervisors
(2 items). More detailed information about the items is
available elsewhere [25]. In addition, hours of work per
week at a main job ( 40 hrs and > 40 hrs per week) and
other paid jobs (yes vs. no) were also self-reported.
The following health conditions and health behaviors were
measured: major depression assessed by the telephone in-
terview, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders III-R [35]; chronic diseases (those
who have experienced or been treated for any of the fol-
lowing during the past 12 months: arthritis, sciatica, recur-
ring stomach trouble or diarrhea, persistent foot troubles,
trouble with varicose veins, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and
hernia; or those who have ever had heart problems or ever
had cancer); obesity (body mass indexes based on self-re-
ported height and weight information,  30 kg/m2) [36];
smoking (current smokers vs. non-smokers); alcohol con-
sumption (moderate drinking -- up to two drinks per day
for men and one drink per day for women [37] during
the past month and heavy drinking -- more than mod-
erate drinking vs. no drinking); and stress-induced over-
eating (those who endorsed either of the following two
items about "how you respond when you are confronted
with difficult or stressful events in your life": "I eat more
than I usually do" and "I eat more of my favorite foods to
make myself feel better").
definition"); and b) based on the quartiles of job control
and psychological job demands (resulting in 16 possible
cells) [26, see Figure 2-e, p. 195] for avoiding potential
misclassification of the four quadrants of the DC model
around the medians of job control and psychological job
demands. The 4 cells in the middle were labeled as "mid-
dle group" and the other 12 cells (3 corner cells for each)
were labeled as active, low strain, high strain, and passive
jobs (hereafter called "five-group definition").
Outcome -- active LTPA
Active LTPA was defined by moderate or vigorous level
of LTPA which is long enough to work up a sweat, several
times a week, during the summer or the winter. It is quite
consistent with the contemporary minimum recommenda-
tion of physical activity for US adults [1,3,4]: at least 5 days
of week for moderate physical activity and at least 3 days
per week for vigorous physical activity. In detail, vigorous
andmoderateLTPAwereeachassessedwithoneitem[23]:
"during your leisure time or free time, how often do you
engage in vigorous physical activity that causes your heart
to beat so rapidly that you can feel it in your chest and you
perform the activity long enough to work up a good sweat
and are breathing heavily?"; and "during your leisure time
or free time, how often do you engage in moderate physi-
cal activity, that is not physically exhausting, but it causes
your heart rate to increase slightly and you typically work
up a sweat?", respectively.
The items were specified further for the summer and
the winter, considering a possible seasonable variation
of LTPA. They had a 6-frequency based response set (sev-
eral times a week, once a week, several times a month,
once a month, less than once a month, and never). A pre-
liminary analysis revealed little seasonal (summer vs. win-
ter) variation in responses to the vigorous and moderate
physical activity items: Spearman correlations were 0.90
and 0.87, respectively. Nonetheless, in this study, we
still retained seasonal specificity in the definition of ac-
tive LTPA (i.e., during the summer or the winter) to mini-
mize potential misclassification of the LTPA outcome
variable (essentially equivalent to controlling for potential
confounding by season).

conditions; Model 3 -- additionally with other working
conditions, data sources, and socio-demographic variables;
and Model 4 -- additionally with other working conditions,
data sources, socio-demographic variables, health condi-
tions, and health behavior variables. In addition, the above
multivariate analyses were replicated with stratification
of the data by sex and education (Table 5) in consider-
ation of potential interactions between sex, education, and
the psychosocial work characteristics on active LTPA.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics of vigorous and moderate levels
of LTPA are presented in Table 1. The bivariate associations
of the study variables with active LTPA were examined by
chi square tests (Table 2). The associations were then inves-
tigated through a series of multivariate logistic regression
models (Tables 3 and 4): Model 1 -- only two variables (job
control and job demands) or the four quadrants of the DC
model; Model 2 -- additionally with other working

The difference in prevalence of active LTPA between ac-
tive and passive jobs became slightly larger when the five-
group definition of the DC model was used than when
the four-group definition was used.
Age (younger workers), race (whites), high levels of edu-
cation and annual household income, low physical effort
at work, being non-obese, non-smokers, and moderate
level of alcohol consumption were strongly (p < 0.01) as-
sociated with active LTPA. Data-source subsamples, sex,
marital status, supervisor support at work, hours of work
per week, major depression, and stress-related overeating
were not associated with active LTPA. Having a chronic
disease and a second job were marginally (p < 0.10) as-
sociated with active LTPA.
Multivariate associations with active LTPA
Controlling for other working conditions such as social
supportatwork,hoursofwork,secondjob,andphysicalef-
fort at work had little effect on the association between job
control and active LTPA (Table 3). However, the associa-
tion was attenuated to some extent by socio-demographic
variables (particularly education and annual household
income). Nonetheless, the highest level (vs. the lowest
level) of job control was still significantly associated with
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics of active LTPA
The prevalence of vigorous and moderate levels of LTPA
was 29.5% and 39.0%, respectively in the study sam-
ple. Twenty four per cent (24.0%) of the study sample
engaged in both vigorous and moderate LTPA; 15.1%
only in moderate LTPA; and 5.5% only in vigorous LTPA.
Thus, 44.6 % of the study sample engaged in active LTPA
(i.e., moderate or vigorous LTPA). There was little differ-
ence in LTPA between men and women (Table 1).
Bivariate associations with active LTPA
In bivariate analyses, higher levels of job control were
significantly (p < 0.001) associated with active LTPA
(Table 2) in US male and female workers. Active LTPA
was also slightly higher among workers in the highest
quartile of psychological job demands; however, this as-
sociation was not statistically significant. Active LTPA was
most prevalent in active jobs, while it was least prevalent
in passive jobs, although the differences were small be-
tween passive and high strain jobs and between active and
low strain jobs, reflecting the lack of a significant associa-
tion between psychological job demands and active LTPA.

The associations of active job and low strain job (vs. pas-
sive job) and LTPA based on the five-group defini-
tion in two subsamples (male higher education and
female low education groups) were similar to those in
the whole sample. However, the combinations of job
control and psychological job demands were not as-
sociated with active LTPA in the other two subsam-
ples: male low education and female higher education
groups. In the male low education group, longer work
hours (> 40 hours/week) and the low and middle lev-
els of annual household income were associated with
less active LTPA: OR (95% CI) = 0.46 (0.23­0.92);
0.20 (0.08­0.54); and 0.38 (0.16­0.89), respectively,
in Model 4. On the other hand, in the female higher
education group, high physical effort at work was mar-
ginally (p = 0.06) associated with active LTPA: OR
(95% CI) = 1.57 (0.98­2.50) in Model 4.
DISCUSSION
This study examined the associations between psychoso-
cial work characteristics and leisure-time physical activity
in middle-aged US workers, using a recent US national
(MIDUS II) dataset. In this study, high job control and
its combinations with psychological job demands (active
jobs) were identified as possible facilitators of active LTPA
in the US workers. However, some discrepancies in this
pattern of results were observed in stratified analyses
by sex and education level. Particularly, in a subsample
of male workers with only high school or lower education,
work hours greater than 40 hours per week and annual
household income less than $100 000 were associated with
less active LTPA, while psychosocial work characteristics
were not associated with active LTPA. Psychological job
demands alone were not associated with active LTPA.
These results, if confirmed in prospective analyses, would
indicate a new avenue for promoting active LTPA in mid-
dle-aged US workers, i.e., increasing workers' on-the-job
learning opportunities and workers authority on their
tasks. However, the lack of a beneficial effect of high job
control on men with lower levels of education needs to be
explored further.
active LTPA in the final model in which health conditions
and health behaviors were also controlled for (Table 3),
with an odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI))
of 1.60 (1.18­2.16). Psychological job demands were not
associated with active LTPA, as in the bivariate analysis.
Active job (vs. passive job) based on the four group
definition was significantly associated with active LTPA,
after controlling for other working conditions:
OR (95% CI) = 1.50 (1.16­1.95). However, the associa-
tion was non-significant when additionally controlling
for socio-demographic variables (particularly education
and annual household income) (Table 4). However, ac-
tive job (vs. passive job) based on the five-group defi-
nition, was significantly associated with active LTPA,
even after controlling for all of the covariates (Table 4),
OR (95% CI) = 1.46 (1.06­2.03). Low strain job
(vs. passive job) was also associated with active LTPA:
OR (95% CI) = 1.60 (1.14­2.25).
As in the bivariate analysis, age (younger workers), race
(whites), high levels of education and annual household
income, being non-obese, non-smokers, and moderate
level of alcohol consumption were associated with ac-
tive LTPA in the multivariate analyses. The one exception
was low physical effort at work. It was not a significant con-
tributor when controlling for socio-demographic variables
(particularly education and annual household income)
(Model 3 in Table 3).
Multivariate associations with active LTPA
by gender and education
We replicated the above multivariate analyses after strati-
fying the data by sex and education. For a simpler analy-
sis, we combined together the high and middle education
groups (called higher education group). So four sub-sam-
ples were created for the higher/low education groups
in each of men and women (see Table 5).
There were no statistically significant interactions between
sex, education, and psychological job demands on ac-
tive LTPA (data not shown here). The highest level of job
controlwasassociatedwithactiveLTPAinthreeofthefour
subsamples. However, this was not the case in a subsample
of male workers with low education (N = 240).

low LTPA in men, but not in women. However, the study
did not provide information about any variation in LTPA
among the three non-active jobs (active, high strain, and
low strain), which would be useful for more fully explor-
ing the active-passive hypothesis of the DC model for
active LTPA.
Implications for theories and policies
Strictly speaking, this study did not support the active-
passive hypothesis in that the prevalence of active LTPA
was greater in low strain jobs than in active jobs, which
is a deviation from the predicted gradient of LTPA along
the active-passive axis. In other studies, LTPA was also
most prevalent in low strain jobs among the four quad-
rants of the DC model [14,18,22], although this was not
always the case [15,21].
These findings indicate that not only the active-passive
hypothesis, but also the "strain" hypothesis (a low strain
job would be least stressful while a high strain job would
be most stressful to workers) of the DC model may play
a role in active LTPA of workers. That is, the accumula-
tion of strain in a high strain job could inhibit workers
from engaging in LTPA. Landsbergis et al. [40, Figure 1]
illustrated how the two distinct hypotheses could explain
the same health behavior via different mechanisms (work
strain vs. learned passivity) in workers. If the two mecha-
nisms work together in reality and the relative importance
of each mechanism could be determined in context, it
might be difficult to expect a clear gradient of LTPA along
the active-passive axis of the DC model in empirical stud-
ies. Future longitudinal epidemiological studies in which
qualitative methods [41] are also employed to investigate
the two mechanisms in detail would be needed for testing
the above speculation.
On the other hand, this study implies that other work-
related factors such as longer work hours and low annual
household income are important occupational determi-
nants of LTPA and may be more important than the psy-
chosocial work characteristics in less-educated male work-
ers. The importance of time and money [8] as material
resources for off-the-job participation should not be ig-
nored. Overtime, along with shift work and second job,
Comparisons with other studies
The results of this study were similar to those of the only
other previous US study [15] from 32 worksites in Min-
nesota, that is job control and active jobs were associated
with LTPA, but psychological job demands were not as-
sociated with LTPA. Our study has some advantages over
the previous study. First, this study was based on a na-
tional US survey, thus its results could be more generaliz-
able to the US working population. Second, this study ad-
dressed as its main outcome specifically the contemporary
recommended minimum level of physical activity for US
adults [3,4]. In addition, this study revealed that associa-
tions could be gender- and social status-specific. Thus its
results would be more informative in evaluating and estab-
lishing public health policies for US adults.
The results of this study for job control and psychologi-
cal job demands and LTPA are also consistent with those
of the majority of non-US studies. Five studies [6,14­18]
supported the association between job control and LTPA
at least in either men or women. Although one Japanese
study [20] in 12 rural communities generally did not sup-
port the association, it also reported a significant associa-
tion between job control and LTPA in a subsample with
female workers (farming and forestry, and fisheries). One
study [12] from the United Kingdom did not support
the association, but limited variation in job control existed
among its study subjects, which might make it harder to
detect an association. Only one study [6] reported a bivari-
ate association between high psychological job demands
and LTPA. However, none of the other studies [12,14,
16­18,20] supported such an association. Even one Swed-
ish study [16] reported that a high level of psychological
job demands (hectic job and psychologically demanding
job) was a risk factor for sedentary LTPA in women.
In this study, although the association between active
jobs (vs. passive jobs) and active LTPA was supported
in the whole sample, it was not supported in two out
of the four subsamples. Similarly, the association has been
inconsistent across the other studies or between men and
women [6,14,15,21,22,38]. A recent prospective analy-
sis [39] from the Whitehall II study reported that "pas-
sive jobs" (vs. all non­passive jobs) is a risk factor for

represents certain racial and ethnic groups (e.g., blacks)
and people with low level of education. Thus, interpreta-
tions of the study results should be made in consideration
of the "selective" characteristics of study subjects. Third,
self-reported measures of psychosocial work character-
istics and active LTPA could be vulnerable to self-report
bias. However, the measures of job control and psycho-
logical job demands in this study were quite similar to
those of the JCQ, which has been extensively validated
in several working populations including the US [49].
Although the meanings of some items of the JCQ psy-
chological job demands scale (work fast and work hard
items) [49,50] could be interpreted differently by social
status (white collar vs. blue collar), our psychological job
demands measure did not include such items. In addi-
tion, we minimized this possibility via a stratified analy-
sis by education level and adjustment for physical effort
at work. In addition, the information from single items
based on either a sweat episode or heart rate/breath-
ing [30,51,52], very similar to the physical activity items
in this study, were validated against the information from
long physical activity questionnaires or a physical activity
monitor in US adults. So we do not believe that such self-
report bias, if any, would significantly bias our results.

was reported by blue-collar workers as a main barrier to
their participation in a workplace health promotion pro-
gram [42]. Low income has been a well-documented risk
factor for LTPA [31]. It may have additional meanings for
less-educated male workers for LTPA, although we cannot
rule out the possibility of a residual socioeconomic status
effect of income.
This study suggests that job control may be an important
occupational determinant of active LTPA in middle-aged
US workers. Jaffee and Rex [43] noted one common fea-
ture of female workers who were not actively engaged
in physical activity: "it is possible that women who were
not active have never been active and don't know how
to start or how to implement an exercise plan" (p. 27).
Having on-the-job learning opportunities and decision
authority on their tasks, known to be beneficial to pre-
venting common mental disorders [44] and cardiovascu-
lar diseases [45], could be also conductive to active LTPA
in US workers. However, unfortunately, psychosocial
work characteristics have been disregarded in recent lit-
erature reviews [31,46] on social and environmental de-
terminants of LTPA. In order to promote LTPA in US
workers, we need to seriously take into consideration
psychosocial work characteristics as a new avenue, which
is philosophically consistent with an ecological health
promotion model [47].
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, despite the con-
sistency with other studies, we cannot draw causal in-
ferences about the association between psychosocial
work characteristics on active LTPA in US workers
based on this secondary analysis of cross-sectional data.
Although we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse
causation, we believe that the directionality of the asso-
ciation would be likely to be forward rather than back-
ward since most people cannot choose or change working
conditions as easily as they can do LTPA [48]. Second,
although the MIDUS II was a national study, with par-
ticipants recruited from diverse occupations and indus-
tries across the US, it is not necessarily representative
of the entire US working population. The dataset under-
