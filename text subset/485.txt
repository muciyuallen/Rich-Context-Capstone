Abstract
Background Antisocial lifestyle includes a range of related
behaviours which constitute threats to health. Links between
health outcomes and particular behaviours have been investi-
gated, but the overall impact on health is largely unknown. In
part, this reflects lack of longitudinal studies designed to link
offending and other antisocial behaviour, injury and illness.
Methods Injury and illness data were collected prospectively
in the longitudinal Cambridge Study of Delinquent Develop-
ment (CSDD) for the age ranges 16­18 and 27­32. These
data were translated into Read clinical codes, version 3.1 and
categorized. Three hypotheses underpinned this investiga-
tion: that links between (i) convictions and injury and be-
tween (ii) childhood predictors of delinquency and injury at
age 16­18 would be maintained at age 27­32; that (iii) anti-
social behaviour at age 16­18 would be linked to injury at age
27­32; and that (iv) observed links between antisocial
behaviour and decreased illness at age 16­18 would be
reversed by age 27­32.
Results Childhood predictors of teenage offending predicted
injury and cardiovascular and psychological illness at age
27­32. Delinquency predicted road, home and self injury and
psychological disorder, but was associated with less illness
and hospital admission. Measures of antisocial behaviour at
age 18 which most strongly predicted illness/injury at age 32
were drunk driving, fighting after drinking, sexual promiscu-
ity and heavy smoking. Relationships at age 16­18 between
heavy alcohol consumption and less infection and less
organic illness remained at age 27­32. Links common to both
age 16­18 and age 27­32 were those between convictions,
heavy regular drinking, low job status and injury; and links
between convictions and less organic illness. Principal differ-
ences included links between convictions and psychological
disorders only found at age 27­32.
Conclusions Antisocial lifestyle was associated with injury
and psychological disorders up to age 32 but also with less
organic illness. Alcohol consumption at age 16­18 predicted
fewer illnesses overall, and fewer infections 15 years later.
These negative associations are important and deserve further
study.

Introduction
Although specific behaviours, such as substance misuse, violent
offending and sexual promiscuity constitute self-evident health
risks, the overall relationship between antisocial lifestyle and
health is largely unknown. In part, this reflects absence of longit-
udinal investigations of links between offending and its pre-
cursors, and illness and injury.
Prospective longitudinal data on both offending and morbid-
ity are available however, from the Cambridge Study of Delin-
quent Development (CSDD) and have been studied to find out
how illness and injury relate to concurrent offending, whether
offending predicts illness and injury or vice versa and whether
relations persist after adjustment for childhood predictors of
offending.1 When information about injuries and illnesses
between ages 16 and 18 was set against information on offend-
ing and other types of antisocial behaviour, it was found that
males who were injured, especially in assaults, tended to be
convicted, to be violent, to have unskilled manual jobs and to
be generally antisocial. Surprisingly, respiratory tract illnesses
were negatively related to convictions and antisocial behaviour
in general. However, illicit drug users were significantly likely to
be ill. Adult convictions were predicted by childhood trouble-
some behaviour, daring/hyperactivity, low IQ/attainment, a
convicted parent, family disruption/poor supervision and
poverty. Assault injuries and respiratory tract illnesses did not
predict adult convictions independently of these childhood fac-
tors. This first longitudinal study of offending and health con-
cluded that injury is one symptom of an antisocial personality
which arises in childhood and persists into adulthood and there-
fore, that measures that lead to a reduction in offending (like
pre-school education and early family support) should also lead
to a reduction in concurrent injuries. It was concluded that the
observed negative relation between a range of antisocial
behaviours and respiratory tract illness deserved further investi-
gation.1
The study reported here was designed to do this by investi-
gating relations between childhood predictors of delinquency,
teenage offending and other delinquent behaviour, injury and
illness at age 16­18; and offending and health measures 14 years
later, at age 27­32. This second investigation using data from
the same longitudinal study was driven by four hypotheses: first,
that the observed association between convictions and more
injury observed at age 18 would be maintained at age 32;

secondly, that associations between childhood predictors of
delinquency and more injury would be maintained at age 32;
thirdly, that measures of antisocial behaviour at age 18 would
be linked to more injury at age 32; and fourthly, that the
observed association between childhood predictors, concurrent
measures of delinquency and decreased illness observed at age
18 would be reversed by age 32. In relation to this fourth
hypothesis, it was considered that although links between heavy
drinking, heavy smoking and illness were not present at age
16­18, these threats to health (linked to antisocial behaviour)
would have begun to take their toll in terms of measurable
impacts on health by a decade and a half later.
Methods
The Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development
Research methods adopted in this study are described in a
report of an investigation of links between offending, injuries
and illness up to the age of 18.1 In summary, the CSDD is a
prospective longitudinal survey of the development of offending
and antisocial behaviour in 411 London males. At the time they
were first contacted in 1961/1962 they were all living in a working
class city area of South London. The sample was all the boys
who were then aged 8­9 and on the registers of six state primary
schools within a 1 mile radius of a research office that had been
established. Hence, the most common year of birth of these
males was 1953. In nearly all cases (94 per cent), the family
breadwinner at that time, usually the father, had a working class
occupation (skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled manual worker).
Most of the males were white (97 per cent) and of British origin.
The original aim of the study was to describe the development
of delinquent and criminal behaviour in inner city males, to
investigate how far it could be predicted in advance, and to
explain why juvenile delinquency began, why it did or did not
continue into adult crime, and why adult crime usually ended as
men reached their 20s. A major aim in this study was to measure
as many factors as possible that might be causes or correlates of
offending. Reflecting this, in the research reported here, injury
and illness data were studied 20 years after data collection
because previously, no hypotheses relating to health outcomes
had been considered. Recently, prompted by the authors'
concern that antisocial lifestyle may have unknown effects on
health, and by the availability of relevant longitudinal data, this
study was undertaken.
Interviews and tests
The males were interviewed and tested in their schools by male
or female psychologists when they were aged about 8, 10 and 14.
They were interviewed in a research office at about 16, 18 and 21
and in their homes at about 25 and 32 by young male social
science graduates. At all ages, except 21 and 25, the aim was to
interview the whole sample, and it was always possible to trace
and interview a high proportion ­ for example, 389 out of 410
still alive at age 18 (95 per cent) and 378 out of 403 still alive at
age 32 (94 per cent). The tests in schools measured individual
characteristics, such as intelligence, attainment, personality and
psychomotor impulsivity, while information was collected in
the interviews about such topics as living circumstances,
employment histories, relationships with females, leisure activ-
ities such as drinking and fighting and offending behaviour.
In addition to these interviews and tests, the boys' parents
were interviewed by female social workers who visited their
home. This happened about once a year from when the male
was about 8 until he was aged 14­15 and in his last year of com-
pulsory education. The primary informant was the mother,
although many fathers were also seen. The parents provided
details about such matters as family income, family size, their
employment histories, their child rearing practices (including
attitudes, discipline and parental disharmony), their degree of
supervision of the boy and his temporary or permanent separa-
tions from them. Teachers completed questionnaires when the
boys were aged about 8, 10, 12 and 14 to provide information
about their troublesome and aggressive school behaviour, their
attention deficits, their school attainments and their truancy.
Ratings were also obtained from their peers when they were in
primary school, about such topics as their daring, dishonesty,
troublesomeness and popularity.2
For the analyses described in this paper, each predictor vari-
able was dichotomized as far as possible into the `worst' quarter
(e.g. the quarter with lowest income or lowest intelligence)
versus the remainder. This was done in order the compare the
importance of different variables and also to permit a risk factor
approach. Because most variables were originally classified into
a small number of categories and because fine distinctions
between categories could not be made very accurately, this
dichotomizing did not usually involve a great loss of informa-
tion. The one quarter/three quarters split was chosen to match
the prior expectation that about one quarter of the sample
would be convicted as juveniles.2
Searches were also conducted in the central Criminal Record
Office (National Identification Bureau) in London to try to
locate findings of guilt of the males, of their parents, of their
brothers and sisters and later of their wives and cohabitees. The
minimum age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is
10. The Criminal Record Office contains records of all serious
offences committed in Great Britain or Ireland and also acts as a
repository for records of minor juvenile offences committed in
London. Convictions were only counted if they were for
offences normally recorded in the Criminal Record Office, such
as thefts, burglaries, violence, vandalism and drug use. In this
paper, the recorded age of offending is the age at which an
offence was committed, not the age of conviction.
Health data
Injury and illness data were recorded for the 2 year period when
subjects were aged 16­18 and for the 5 year period when they
were aged 27­32 in the following manner. Interviewers recorded
all the illnesses that led to absences from work of a week or more
IMPACT OF ANTISOCIAL LIFESTYLE ON HEALTH 349
­ or equivalent if not working, what was wrong, when the illness
occurred, how it was managed, how many days off work it
caused and the length of time if any in hospital. Men were also
asked about operations and treatment that had been required.
Accounts of these illnesses were amplified by the interviewers in
free text. Information about injuries was recorded in precisely
the same way except that men were asked about the circum-
stances and causes of injury.
The illnesses and injuries recorded by the interviewers were
translated into Read clinical codes, version 3.1. On the basis of
the Read codes, assigned illnesses were grouped into respiratory,
cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, skin, allergic, gastrointestinal
and psychological/neurological disorders. Injuries were charac-
terized by their cause. The main causes of injury were assault,
motorcycle, home and work accidents and sport. Data were ana-
lysed by means of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.
Results
Of 378 men coded, 185 (49 per cent) experienced an illness
between ages 27 and 32 compared with 258 of 387 (67 per cent)
who experienced an illness between ages 16 and 18; and 102
(27 per cent) experienced an injury at age 27­32 compared with
211 at age 16­18 (55 per cent: Table 1), despite an increase in the
observation period from 2 to 5 years. The most common type of
illness was infection ­ mostly respiratory tract disease [such as
flu and bronchitis; 15 per cent (52 per cent at age 16­18)],
followed by gastrointestinal disease [such as appendicitis, ulcer,
gastric flu, food poisoning: 7 per cent (10 per cent at age 16­18)],
skin disease [for example, acne, boils, dermatitis, shingles:
2 per cent (9 per cent at age 16­18)], allergic illness [including
hayfever, allergic reaction, asthma, eczema: 0.5 per cent (5 per
cent at age 16­18)] and psychological/neurological disorders
[such as migraine, depression, nervous rash, nervous break-
down: 3 per cent (5 per cent at age 16­18)]. The most common
category of injury was work injury [11 per cent (21 per cent at
age 16­18)], followed by sports injury [6 per cent (12 per cent)],
assault injury [1 per cent (8 per cent at age 16­18)], and home
injury [1 per cent (6 per cent at age 16­18)].
In the following sections, Tables 1­5 present only the signific-
ant findings among the very large number of correlations studied.
Illness and injury versus offending (Table 2)
Men who were injured on the roads between ages 27 and 32 were
significantly more likely to be convicted at some stage, particu-
larly between 19 and 32. There were also significant links
between self and home injury and convictions after age 22.
There were significant links between psychological disorders
and convictions at age 27­32, in contrast to age 16­18. There
was also a link between age of conviction and the chances of
psychological disorder; the strongest link was between concur-
rent convictions at 19­40 and psychological disorders. Overall
however, there were highly significant negative relations between
illness, particularly organic illness, and convictions.
Concurrent antisocial behaviour (Table 3)
There were few significant links between measures of concurrent
antisocial behaviour, illness and injury. Again, both negative
and positive correlations were found: negative relations between
hospital admission and self-reported delinquency (SRD), but
positive relations between illness overall, psychological illness
and SRD and drug use.

(Table 4)
The most striking links were negative associations between
heavy alcohol consumption at age 16­18 and later infections/
organic illness. Motoring convictions predicted fewer illnesses

and injuries. Low pulse rate in early adulthood predicted less
cardiovascular illness, but more road injury 15 years later. The
risk of surgical intervention was more than threefold higher for
those who committed drunk driving at age 16­18. The risk of
psychological illness was more than threefold higher for those
who reported fighting after drinking at age 16­18. The risk of
skin disease was more than threefold higher for those who
reported heavy smoking at age 16­18. Sleep disruption at age
16­18 predicted assault injury.

IMPACT OF ANTISOCIAL LIFESTYLE ON HEALTH 351
Childhood precursors (Table 5)
There is a great deal of previous research in the Cambridge
Study on the early childhood precursors of offending.2 These
fall into six major categories ­ antisocial child behaviour, impul-
sivity, school failure, an antisocial family, poor parenting and
economic deprivation. Not surprisingly, there were far fewer
significant links between these precursors, and injury and illness
at age 27­32 than there were at age 16­18. Negative relations
were found between childhood hyperactivity/low concentration
and work injury 15 years later, and the strongest positive corre-
lations were between high neuroticism at age 14 and skin
disorders; and between poor parental supervision and cardio-
vascular disorders.
Discussion
Most interestingly perhaps, the results of this and an earlier
study of links between an antisocial lifestyle, injury and illness at
age 16­18, both show some striking negative relationships. For
example, convictions were associated with fewer respiratory
illnesses at age 16­18 and fewer illnesses overall and fewer
organic illnesses at age 27­32. Furthermore, concurrent anti-
social behaviour was inversely related to respiratory infections
at age 16­18 and also to hospital admission at age 27­32. Child-
hood precursors linked to lower risk of infections at age 16­18
were daring and low income. These links had disappeared by
age 27­32 but new inverse relations had, by then, become
apparent. For example, at 27­32 lower risk of work injury was
linked to childhood hyperactivity and low concentration. Further
inverse relations were found between antisocial behaviour at
age 18 and health outcomes at age 27­32 ­ principally between
heavy alcohol consumption, infections and organic illness.
Overall, there is clearly some stability in these negative
relationships. Potential explanations relate to the protective
effect in terms of infection risk of large family size;1 a propensity
of offenders not to take time off work; and some protective
effect of infections on offending ­ for example, through limiting
outdoor activity or physical fitness. One of the most important
studies of protective factors and resilience was carried out by
Werner and Smith,3 who followed up over 500 Hawaii children
from birth to age 32. They identified one-third of the children
as high-risk because they were born into poverty and experi-
enced perinatal stress, family discord or divorce, parental
alcoholism or mental illness. One-third of these high-risk
children were considered to be resilient, because they had no
crime record or mental illness by age 18, and most of them grew
up into competent, successful adults at age 32. However, inter-
estingly, the resilient children were more likely to have health
problems at age 32 (e.g. ulcers, chronic back problems, obesity,
dizziness or fainting spells) than high-risk children who became
offenders (54.5 per cent compared with 10.3 per cent for males).
Moderate alcohol consumption is known to be associated
with decreased risk of respiratory tract infections.4 It is also pos-
sible that antisocial individuals neglect illness or seek treatment
less often.5 Whatever the mechanism, this protective effect
extended to fewer hospital admissions by age 32. Furthermore,
self-reported delinquency at 32 was also negatively related to
hospital admission at the same age. On the other hand, by age
32, earlier antisocial behaviours, like fighting after drinking and
heavy smoking, had become linked to illness ­ particularly
psychological and skin disorders; and low job status was posi-
tively related to hospital admission.
Therefore, an antisocial lifestyle and its childhood pre-
cursors seem to be associated with both negative and positive
health outcomes. Interestingly, one physiological measure, low
heart rate at age 16­18, was positively associated with injury at
both age 16­18 and age 27­32 but negatively with cardiovascular
disorders at age 27­32. This fits with the concept that physical
fitness ­ one of the causes of low heart rate ­ carries with it both
the risk of injury and cardiovascular protection.
Overall, a consistent finding up to age 32, was links between
convictions, concurrent antisocial behaviour, childhood pre-
cursors of antisocial behaviour and injury. These links were
much stronger at age 16­18 when both injury and conviction
rates were much higher, than at age 27­32. However, against a
background of work and sport injury at both ages, assault
injury was much more frequent at 16­18 compared to 27­32
(only four men reported assault injury at 27­32 compared to 29
at age 16­18). This fits with the known peak ages for antisocial
behaviour in boys and also with desistance from offending after
the age of about 20.
The other principal differences between relations at the two

ages were significant links between convictions and self-reported
delinquency and psychological disorders at age 27­32, which
were not found at age 16­18. There was also an age response
effect from age 19 up to age 32, with convictions an increasingly
powerful predictor of psychological disorders.
Returning to the hypotheses which informed this research,
these findings indicate that the positive relationship between
antisocial behaviour and injury observed at age 16­18 was
maintained up to at least 32 years of age, though the prevalence
of injury fell markedly. Secondly, whilst, overall negative rela-
tions between convictions and illness remained, the corrosive
effect on mental health of convictions was apparent by age 32.
Interestingly, one childhood predictor of offending, poor
parental supervision, also predicted cardiovascular disorders.
Most interestingly perhaps, convictions still had an overall
significant negative relation with illness at age 32. With regard
to mental health outcomes, however, this study provides evidence
of a positive age-related effect of convictions on psychological
disorders after age 18, in the 2 years prior to which no significant
associations between offending and psychological disorders
were found.
This longitudinal study allows causal inferences to be drawn,
particularly since the direction of effect was consistently from
convictions to later psychological disorder. In this context,
offender treatment programmes are necessary not just to treat
established psychological problems arising out of substance
misuse for example, but also the mental health problems which
appear to be complications either of convictions (proof of guilt)
or of criminal justice sentences (`remedies') for offending, or a
combination of both. The link found in this study between
assault injury and sleep disruption may reflect chronic post-
traumatic stress disorder, anxiety or depression.6,7
On the basis of these findings, the principal health impacts of
an antisocial lifestyle occur most frequently, not surprisingly,
when antisocial behaviour is at its most frequent. Adverse
impacts are of two types: short-term impacts ­ such as most
injuries, and longer term impacts, such as psychological
disorders and alcohol or other drug dependence. There are
other long-term impacts, not assessed here, which include those
associated with teenage pregnancy. This cohort of men reached
the age of 25 (in 1978) before HIV infection became a significant
risk. The results of this study are consistent with the association
between antisocial behaviour and the constellation of impacts
on health comprising DATES syndrome (Drug Abuse, Assault,
Trauma and Elective Surgery).8 From a prevention standpoint,
the obvious implication of this is to limit the chances of long-
term effects like dependence, and, in view of the links between
convictions and psychological disorders, chronic involvement
with the criminal justice system. Reductions in convictions seem
likely to have substantial benefits for mental health, particularly
after the age of 20. Given links between convictions and psycho-
logical disorders, future research should seek to compare the
impact of traditional criminal justice and of alternative criminal
justice `remedies' such as restorative justice on the mental health
of offenders.
Where risk taking is at its most prevalent, situational preven-
tion and targeted policing is most effective.9 One implication of
these findings is that prevention of offending and of childhood
precursors of offending, for example, by pre-school education
and early family support, is likely to improve health mainly by
preventing injury and drug misuse in early adulthood and also
by preventing psychological disorders and skin disease in sub-
sequent decades. Another implication is that because an anti-
social lifestyle is associated with comparatively low rates of illness
at least up to age 32, research and health promotion effort should
be invested in trying to identify underlying protective factors,
events and mechanisms, whilst reducing opportunities and pro-
pensity to offend. Since alcohol may be at the root of both
health protective effects and injury, alcohol harm reduction is
an important priority.10 In this context, making sure that treat-
ment for injury includes management of alcohol misuse, for
example, by combining wound care for young males with brief
alcohol interventions may be particularly cost effective.11
At present, the prevention of offending and the prevention of
injury and illness are considered and organized separately. The
findings of this study, including positive associations between
risk taking and health, suggest that a more integrated approach
to prevention ­ in which offender rehabilitation and public health
practitioners collaborate ­ would pay substantial dividends.
