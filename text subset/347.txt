THE National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
(NSHAP) assessed health-related behaviors as factors
directly related both to physical health and well-being and
to social relationships. Two key health-related behaviors in-
cluded in the NSHAP survey are smoking and alcohol use.
The impact of these behaviors on health is well established.
In NSHAP, one of the primary interests is in how the degree
to which individuals engage in these behaviors mediates the
relationship between social relationships and health. Higher
quality social relationships, for instance, are associated with
lower risk of problem drinking (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000).
Both close and distant ties in social networks influence
smoking behavior, and conversely, smoking influences the
quality of social relationships, with smokers having more
peripheral positions in their social networks than nonsmok-
ers (Christakis & Fowler, 2008).
In this paper, we describe the measures of smoking behav-
iors and alcohol use collected in the first wave of NSHAP,
including their distributions by gender and age. We describe
construction of widely used derived measures that are readily
obtained from the NSHAP core variables, discuss key prop-
erties of these variables, and present examples of associations
among them. In addition to self-report of tobacco use, NS-
HAP provides a biological marker of this activity, cotinine,
which we describe in detail, with examination of its relation-
ship to selected self-reported smoking behaviors. Other
health-related behaviors assessed by NSHAP, but not consid-
ered here, include physical exercise, sleep, elements of sexual
behavior, and certain aspects of health care utilization.
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. A
Methods section briefly summarizes relevant aspects of the
survey design, data collection methods, biomeasure pro-
cessing, and the data analytic approach, followed by sepa-
rate sections for alcohol consumption, self-reported smoking
behaviors, and the biological marker of tobacco exposure,
cotinine. Each of the domain-specific sections includes a
description of the measures and their properties, their distri-
butions by age group and gender, selected associations
among the measures, response rates, and a brief discussion.
Methods
Study Design and Data Collection
NSHAP Wave 1 data were collected during in-home
interviews, conducted in 2005­2006 with a probability
sample of 3,005 community-dwelling U.S. residents,
aged 57­85 years. The NSHAP study design is described
in detail in O'Muircheartaigh and colleagues (this issue)
and Smith and colleagues (this issue). We briefly reiterate

Objectives. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) assessed smoking behaviors and alcohol use
as factors directly related to physical health, well-being, and social relationships. We describe self-report measures of tobacco
and alcohol use, as well as an established biological marker of tobacco exposure, cotinine, collected in Wave 1 of NSHAP.
Methods. We compare smoking behaviors and alcohol use by gender and age group. We report on derived measures
of alcohol consumption and tobacco exposure widely used in medical and substance use literature, compare current and
past users, and describe associations between self-reported smoking status and cotinine.
Results. Men are more likely than women to report alcohol use, potential problem drinking, and ever smoking. Alco-
hol use and smoking are lower among older age groups. Although current smoking is less prevalent than in the general
U.S. adult population, 50% of current and 29% of past smokers have lifetime exposure of 40 pack-years or more. Cotinine
is directly related to number of cigarettes per day but with considerable unexplained variation. Cotinine levels contradict
self-report in fewer than 4% of nonsmokers.
Conclusion. NSHAP provides data useful for investigation of smoking and alcohol use and their association with
health and social factors.

features of the design and data collection methods that
apply to measures of smoking behaviors and alcohol use.
In addition to self-report measures of these domains, re-
spondents provided a saliva specimen, which was assayed
for cotinine, a biological measure of tobacco exposure.
The NSHAP sample was constructed to make compari-
sons by gender and age group (ages 57­64, 65­74, and
75­85 years) and was stratified accordingly.
Self-report measures were collected primarily through
computer-assisted in-person interviews, supplemented by a
leave-behind questionnaire. In order to obtain as much in-
formation as possible within the time constraints of the in-
home interview, certain sections were modularized to apply
to a subset of respondents or to be administered partly or
wholly through the leave-behind questionnaire, or both.
Biomeasures were modularized as well. Respondents were
randomized to paths that determined which modules they
received and the mode of administration. All measures of
smoking behaviors and alcohol use, including the biomarker
of tobacco exposure, were in the core set of measures, which
NSHAP sought to obtain from all respondents. Moreover,
all these measures were collected in the home, with one
exception: A screening instrument for problem drinking be-
havior was administered to all respondents in the leave-
behind instrument.
Biomeasure Processing
NSHAP obtained cotinine levels through collection of
salivary specimens, a stable and noninvasive method that is
well accepted by respondents (Binnie et al., 2004). Saliva
specimen collection and processing are described by
Gavrilova and colleagues (this issue). Salivary enzyme im-
munoassay for cotinine concentration was conducted at
Salimetrics, LLC. Details of the assay, as well as additional
information about processing and properties of the measure,
are described in Iqbal, Mendoza, Curran, and Lindau (2007).
Data Analysis
Smoking behaviors and alcohol use are compared by gen-
der and age group, overall and within each gender group.
Prevalences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are given
for levels of categorical and ordinal variables, with associa-
tions tested using the Pearson chi-square statistic, corrected
for survey design with the second-order correction of Rao
and Scott (1987). CIs are based on a logit transform to ensure
that the confidence limits fall between zero and one. Means,
standard deviations, and quartiles are provided for continu-
ous variables, with associations evaluated through linear re-
gression. For variables with skewed distributions, square root
or logarithmic transformations were applied before analysis
to achieve approximate normality. Linear, logistic, ordinal
logistic (McCullagh & Nelder, 1989), and generalized or-
dered logit regression (Williams, 2006), which includes par-
tial proportional odds models as a special case, were used to
further evaluate associations and estimate adjusted effects.
All analyses accounted for the survey sampling design
through incorporation of sampling strata and clusters as well
as weights that adjusted for differential probability of selec-
tion and differential nonresponse. Standard errors were com-
puted using the Taylor linearization method (Binder, 1983).
Weighted estimates are presented unless otherwise noted.
Results are not adjusted for multiple testing. Analyses were
conducted using Stata 10.0 (StataCorp, 2007).
Alcohol Consumption
Among many available instruments, NSHAP adopted two
well-established approaches to assessment of alcohol con-
sumption behavior that were also used in the Health and
Retirement Survey (HRS) 2002 (National Center for Health
Statistics, 2002). The first utilizes the quantity-frequency
(QF) approach (Room, 1990) and the second assesses poten-
tial problem drinking behavior through a four-item screening
instrument, the CAGE (Cut back, Annoyed, Guilt, Eye-
opener) assessment (Ewing, 1984). The QF approach incor-
porates two domains: (a) quantity of alcohol intake within a
reference period and (b) frequency of alcohol consumption
within a reference period, as well as an additional question
on frequency of consuming four or more drinks on one occa-
sion as an indicator of high-risk drinking behavior (Dawson,
2003). The QF approach is recommended, albeit with limita-
tions, when a quick and easy measure is needed due to time
constraints (Sobell & Sobell, 2003).
Measures
All respondents were asked whether they ever drank alco-
holic beverages such as beer, wine, or liquor. Respondents
who stated "no" or "don't know" or who refused to answer
were then asked if they had ever drunk alcohol. Those who
responded "yes" on this item were asked, "Have you drunk
alcohol in the last three months?" Only respondents who
indicated that they drank currently or within the past three
months were then asked the three QF questions: "In the last
three months (the reference period), on average, how many
days per week have you had any alcohol to drink?" with
response options 0 (none or less than one day a week), 1,
2, ... , 7 (the frequency component). Next, respondents were
asked to indicate how many drinks they had on those days
(the quantity component). The quantity and the frequency
components allow measurement of the volume consumed
by multiplying the number of drinks per day by the number
of drinking days per week. Finally, respondents were asked
to indicate on how many days in the same reference period
they had four or more drinks on one occasion.
The CAGE, a widely used clinical screening instrument
that has been used effectively with older adults (Beullens &
Aertgeerts, 2004; Friedmann et al., 1999), was used to
screen for problematic drinking. It is a brief, four-question
instrument, which Mayfield, Mcleod, and Hall (1974) found
NSHAP SMOKING BEHAVIORS AND ALCOHOL USE i121
easy to administer and less intimidating than the full or
shortened version of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening
Test (Pokorny, Miller, & Kaplan, 1972; Seltzer, 1971). Re-
spondents were asked whether they had ever felt that they
should cut down on drinking, whether people had ever
annoyed them by criticizing their drinking, whether they
had ever felt bad or guilty about drinking, and whether they
had ever had a drink first thing in the morning (eye opener)
to steady their nerves or get rid of a hangover. A total of two
or more positive responses have long been used to indicate
alcohol abuse and dependence, with the cutpoint based
on a sensitivity analysis (Fiellin, Reid, & O'Connor, 2000;
Mayfield et al., 1974). The National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), in contrast, recommends
a screening cutpoint of one positive response for clinical use
(Bradley,Kivlahan,Bush,McDonell,&Fihn,2001;NIAAA,
2005), and Friedmann and colleagues (1999) found this cut-
point more suitable for screening elderly hospital emergency
department patients. In our survey, the CAGE instrument
was self-administered in the leave-behind instrument.
Results
The main descriptive findings for drinking behavior are
summarized in Table 1. The results are presented for men
and women separately stratified by three age groups. The
first distribution shown in Table 1 describes the drinking
status variable that was constructed from the first three
questions on drinking behavior included in the interview. Its
values are "current drinker," "former drinker," and "never
drinker." Current alcohol consumption differs substantially,
comparing men with women across all age groups included
in the NSHAP survey. For example, 55% of women versus
72% of men in the youngest age group indicated current
alcohol use. Additionally, women were significantly more
likely than men to report never consuming alcohol. Re-
ported alcohol use also declines across age groups among
both women and men.
Figure 1 presents the distribution of volume of alcohol
consumed, calculated by multiplying the two components
(quantity × frequency), and also presents the frequency com-
ponent of this measure for men and women separately. As
seen in the top panel of Figure 1, frequency of drinking was
significantly higher among men than among women. Women
were more likely than men to drink one or fewer days per
week (58% vs. 43%) and less likely to drink daily (14% vs.
19%). Frequency of drinking also was significantly higher
among older compared with younger men but did not differ
by age among women (not shown). Quantity, in terms of the
number of drinks consumed on days the respondent drank,
was also significantly higher among men and decreased
across age group for both men and women (not shown).
A number of characteristics of the composite volume
measure are illustrated in the parallel boxplots in the lower
panel of Figure 1. Most notably, consumption was higher
among men than among women at all frequencies of drink-
ing, and variability of consumption increased with fre-
quency, particularly among men. By definition, minimum
volume consumed is the number of days per week the per-
son drinks, which is realized when the number of drinks per
day equals one. For women, this is also the median value
among those who drink five or more days a week. For men,
in contrast, the median is two drinks per day, except at the
lowest frequency. Note that volume consumed is zero when
the respondent drinks on average less than one day a week,
no matter how heavily. The overwhelming majority for
whom volume consumed was zero reported drinking three
or fewer drinks on the occasional days when they drank, but
15 (2.4%) respondents with this score reported an average
of four or more drinks per occasion.
The last question included in the in-person interview
deals with risk behavior; the respondents were asked about
consumption of four or more alcoholic drinks on one occa-
sion during the prior three months. The response to this
question was an open-ended count, but due to its skewed
distribution, we generated an ordinal scale with four catego-
ries as shown in Table 1, with cutpoints chosen to corre-
spond roughly to once a month and once a week. The
majority (77.2%) did not engage in heavy drinking behav-
ior, but men were significantly more likely than women at
all ages to report doing so. This risk behavior decreased
across age groups, particularly for men.
As for the CAGE, a consistent and significant gender dif-
ference was observed across all four items, similar to what
was found among the in-person interview questions (Table
1). For example, only 12% of women as compared with 36%
of men aged 57­64 years had ever felt that they should cut
down on drinking. Among men and women, positive re-
sponses to all CAGE items declined with age, although this
trend does not reach statistical significance among women
due to their low overall frequency of positive response. The
four self-administered CAGE items were summed and then
dichotomized at two alternative cutpoints that are used to
indicate potential alcohol abuse and dependence: two or
more positive answers (Fiellin et al., 2000) and one or more
positive answers (Friedmann et al., 1999). These variables
are also described in Table 1. Consistent with the other alco-
hol consumption measures, we found a significant gender
difference for both. There is also evidence for a significant
inverse relationship between age and potential alcohol abuse.
When comparing CAGE responses with self-reported drink-
ing status, 4.3% of individuals who reported never drinking
in the face-to-face interview responded positively to at least
one CAGE item, and 1.2% met the two or more positive re-
sponse criterion for potential alcohol abuse.
Response rates were 98%­99% for drinking items asked in
the in-person interview. Response rates for the CAGE screen-
ing items, which were self-administered in the leave-behind
questionnaire for all respondents, ranged from 88% to 93%
on returned surveys and 76% to 80% overall. In regard to

missing values, nondrinkers were most likely to leave all
items blank (never drinker, 17%; past drinker, 11%; and cur-
rent drinker, 2%), which would be expected if nondrinkers
considered the questions to be irrelevant. However, a small
but non-negligible proportion of respondents (6.3%) an-
swered some but not all the items, most often with some "no"
responses co-occurring with skipped items, which argues
against regarding lack of response as a "no."
Discussion: Alcohol Consumption
The most consistent finding concerning alcohol consum-
ption was the difference across gender. Women in all age
groups consumed less alcohol than men in terms of quan-
tity, frequency, volume of alcohol use, and alcohol abuse.
The evidence found in NSHAP for a gender difference in
alcohol intake is consistent with findings from recent re-
search using data from The Health and Retirement Survey
(United States) and the English Longitudinal Study of
Aging (Lang, Guralnik, Wallace, & Melzer, 2007).
Attention should be paid to the volume consumed mea-
sure that takes into account the average frequency and quan-
tity of alcohol consumption. Although volume consumed is
a commonly used indicator, interpretation of its value can
be misleading. Very different patterns of drinking can yield
identical values (Dawson, 2003; Sobell & Sobell, 2003).
For example, data for a person who drinks one drink every
day will generate the same volume of alcohol intake as data
for a person who drinks seven drinks only one day a week.
Therefore, evaluation of a drinking pattern should be based
on the frequency and quantity components with supplemen-
tal information from the risk behavior measure.
Cigarette Smoking and Other Tobacco Use
Smoking assessment for adults typically includes informa-
tion on smoking status (never, current, or ex-smoker), initia-
tion, cessation, and intensity, which in turn yield measures of
duration, cumulative exposure, and elapsed time since cessa-
tion (Leffondré, Abrahamowicz, Siemiatycki, & Rachet,
2002)--all of which have been linked to disease risk.
Measures
NSHAP assessed cigarette smoking status and history and
current use of other tobacco products (pipe, cigars, snuff, and
chewing tobacco). Smoking status was ascertained through
two survey items. Respondents were first asked, "Do you
smoke cigarettes now?" Those who answered "yes" were
classified as current smokers. All others were asked, "Did
you ever smoke cigarettes regularly?" and were classified as
past or never smokers according to their response. Respon-
dents who identified themselves as current cigarette smokers
were asked the age when they began smoking regularly and
the average number of cigarettes per day they usually smoke.
Similarly, past smokers were asked the age when they began,

the age when they quit, and, on average, how many cigarettes
per day they had usually smoked. Current use of other forms
of tobacco was assessed by asking respondents, "Do you use
any of the other following tobacco products regularly now?
pipe, cigar, snuff, chewing tobacco, none," with instructions
to choose all that apply. Note that for the variable assessing
the age of initiation of regular smoking, responses from
smokers and nonsmokers are in separate variables, which
were merged to apply to both groups before analysis or sub-
sequent variable derivation. The same is true for the variable
assessing the number of cigarettes per day.All items concern-
ing cigarette smoking are drawn from Established Popula-
tions for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (Taylor,
Wallace, Ostfeld, & Blazer, 1998). The other tobacco items
were newly developed for NSHAP.
Combining responses to the smoking history items yields
a number of variables useful for describing and evaluating
smoking behavior, including smoking duration in years,
elapsed time since quitting for past smokers, and pack-
years. For current smokers, smoking duration is calculated
as current age minus age when first smoked regularly, and,
for past smokers, as the difference between age last smoked
and age first smoked. Pack-years is calculated as the num-
ber of years smoked times the average number of packs per
day (20 cigarettes = 1 pack) (National Cancer Institute,
2007). Pack-years is often categorized for analysis, with 20
and 40 pack-years as commonly used risk thresholds (e.g.,
Cruickshanks et al., 1998; Straus, McAlister, Sackett, &
Deeks, 2002; Sturmer, Glynn, Lee, Christen, & Hennekens,
2000), whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) designates 25 pack-years as "heavy smoking"
in its report "Cigarette Smoking Among Adults--United
States, 2004" (CDC, 2005).
Results
The main descriptive findings for smoking are summa-
rized in Table 2. A minority of respondents (15%) reported
current smoking, 44% claimed to be past smokers, and 41%
responded that they had never smoked regularly. Overall,
smoking status differed significantly by gender, age group,
and age group within gender. Prevalence of current smoking
was similar for men and women and decreased with age for
both--from 17% in women and 20% in men at ages 57­64
years to 8% and 9%, respectively, at ages 75­85 years.
Among men, there was a complementary increase in the pro-
portion who reported past smoking, whereas the prevalence
of never smoking was similar across age groups. In contrast,
women in the oldest age group were significantly less likely
to be past smokers and more likely to have never smoked
than their younger counterparts.
Fifty percent of current smokers and 29% of past smok-
ers met or exceeded the widely used high-risk threshold of
40 pack-years. Men had higher cumulative exposure to cig-
arettes by this measure than did women. For current smok-
ers, this gender difference was a consequence of longer
duration and higher intensity (cigarettes per day) among
men, whereas for past smokers, only intensity differed by
gender. On average, men started smoking regularly at a
younger age than women (age 17 among men vs. ages 19­
21 years among women, across age groups), but men who
had quit smoking also did so at a younger age than women
(42.5 vs. 44.7 years) and had correspondingly longer elapsed
time since quitting.
Current smokers had smoked an average of 47.6 years
and past smokers an average of 25 years. Smoking duration
increased significantly with age for both men and women
among past smokers and, as would be expected, among cur-
rent smokers. Smoking intensity (cigarettes per day), in
contrast, varied by age only among current male smokers--
exhibiting a decreasing trend with age. The net effect for
this subgroup was a significant association between age and
cumulative exposure, with the youngest most likely to have
reached 40 pack-years and the oldest most likely to be be-
low 20 pack-years. Past smokers reported significantly
higher smoking intensity than current smokers (on average,
22 vs. 16.7 cigarettes per day), which may be due in part to
different reference periods and changes in smoking patterns
over a lifetime. Nevertheless, current smokers had higher
cumulative exposure whether pack-years was treated con-
tinuously or categorized. Note that among current smokers,
smoking duration confounds with age due to the longer du-
ration of opportunity for older respondents to smoke. This
confounding does not occur with pack-years.
Current use of other tobacco products was reported by
4.7% (95% CI 3.8%­5.9%) of respondents--cigars 2.2%
(1.6%­2.8%), chewing tobacco 1.6% (1.1%­2.5%), pipe
1.1% (0.7%­1.6%), and snuff 0.9% (0.5%­1.5%). Use of
these products was more prevalent among men than among
women (8.4% [6.7%­10.4%] vs. 1.3% [0.7%­2.6%]) but
did not differ significantly by age group and was only mod-
erately associated with cigarette smoking, being more prev-
alent among past smokers (never smokers 3.4%
[2.3%­5.1%], past smokers 5.9% [4.6%­7.6%], and current
smokers 4.7% [2.6%­8.2%]). A very small proportion of
respondents (0.7% [0.4%­1.2%]) reported current use of
two or more of these tobacco products. Response rates for
all self-report smoking items were 98%­99%.
Discussion: Smoking
Self-reported rates of current smoking were lower and
prevalence of past smoking higher in the NSHAP popula-
tion than in the general U.S. adult population, based on es-
timates from 2004 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
data (CDC, 2005). In NSHAP, 16% of men and 14% of
women were current smokers; 53% of men and 36% of
women were past smokers. In the general adult population,
however, 21% were current and 22% past smokers. In the
general population, adults 65 years or older had the lowest

rate of smoking (8.8%), which was realized in NSHAP only
at ages 75­85 years. Although these rates are not directly
comparable, the fact that the NHIS interval includes all ages
>85, and thus spans the NSHAP age interval, suggests con-
sistency between NSHAP and NHIS estimates.
Based on a review of approaches used in 40 articles pub-
lished in epidemiological and clinical journals in 2000,
Leffondré and associates (2002) used data from a case-
control study of lung cancer to investigate how modeling
smoking history impacts estimated effects of cigarette
smoking. Variations included criteria used to distinguish be-
tween current and ex-smokers, whether never smokers were
included when modeling continuous smoking exposure, re-
placing intensity and duration by a single measure (e.g.,
pack-years), and simultaneous modeling of several time-
related smoking variables. They found that estimated effects
may depend substantially upon modeling strategies and
make specific recommendations for use of smoking history
variables in analysis. Although NSHAP differs in design
and focus from the Leffondré study, these issues are still
pertinent and worthy of consideration in working with
smoking data from the NSHAP study.
Salivary Cotinine
Salivary cotinine provides an objective measure of tobacco
exposure that can be used to detect and quantify second-hand
exposure, validate self-reported nonsmoking status, and clas-
sify smokers as occasional or regular. Cotinine is a primary
metabolite of nicotine that has a half-life of 16­18 hr and can
be detected in urine, saliva, or serum; it provides a reliable
means of determining tobacco use or exposure over the prior
two or three days (Iqbal et al., 2007; Montalto &Wells, 2007).
A number of factors, including body mass index (BMI) and
recent food consumption, are known to affect nicotine me-
tabolism and cotinine concentrations (Hukkanen, Jacob, &
Benowitz, 2005) and may contribute to what is often wide
variation in cotinine at the same nominal exposure level--for
example, among smokers who report smoking one pack of
cigarettes per day.
Measures
In the NSHAP core data set, salivary cotinine concentra-
tions are reported in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) for
each of two duplicate assays performed on the individual
saliva samples. Iqbal and associates (2007) provide infor-
mation on details of the assay. The core data set also in-
cludes gender-specific derived variables, described in the
following, that classify respondents as nonsmokers, passive
smokers, occasional smokers, and regular smokers, based
on their mean cotinine concentrations. NSHAP recorded the
time of cotinine measurement and queried respondents about
the elapsed time since last food or drink consumption other
than water, which enables incorporation of these potential
modifying factors in analysis. In addition, a series of variables

mark the status of the saliva sample and assay results (Iqbal
et al., 2007). In particular, flags for each of the duplicate as-
says identify (a) values below the lower limit of sensitivity
of the assay (0.05 ng/ml), which have been recoded as 0; (b)
values that are a "lower bound" on the true value; and (c)
values missing due to insufficient sample quantity or a tech-
nical problem with the sample. The lower bound flag indi-
cates that the cotinine concentration remained above the
upper assay limit of 200 ng/ml after final dilution to 1:20.
Values flagged as lower bounds have all been set to the fixed
value, 200 ng/ml, and thus are not approximations of the
true cotinine concentration. To place this in context, note
that the maximum cotinine concentration in the NSHAP
sample is over 2,400 ng/ml. Additionally, a variable that re-
ports the status of the saliva sample identifies 20 samples
that were not continuously frozen during transport. Calcula-
tion of mean cotinine concentration from the duplicate as-
says is left to individual users, who may choose different
options for dealing with these special cases.
Imputed smoking status is derived from respondents'
mean cotinine concentrations, based on the Wells­Stewart
method described in a 1992 Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) report on passive smoking (U.S. EPA, 1992,
p. 453). Under this method, cutoffs that divide smoking cat-
egories are calculated separately for men and women as
percentages of the observed mean for self-reported smokers
in the sample. Individuals with cotinine concentrations at or
above 30% of this mean value are classified as regular
smokers; those with concentrations between 10% and 30%
of it are classified as occasional smokers. The EPA report
does not address the boundary between passive exposure
and nonexposed nonsmokers. Empirically determined lower
bounds for passive smoking in the literature have ranged
from 7 to 44 ng/ml and higher (e.g., Binnie et al., 2004;
Etter, Vu Due, & Pernegen, 2000; Etzel, 1990), with 10 ng/
ml generally recognized as sensitive and specific for delin-
eating nonsmokers from current smokers (Ogden, Morgan,
Heavner, Davis, & Steichen, 1997). In NSHAP, the value
that best separates nonsmokers and passive smokers is
15 ng/ml for both men and women, providing 91.4% sensi-
tivity and 96.4% specificity for self-reported nonsmoking in
men, and 95.9% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity in women.
Cotinine values with the lower bound flag, aforementioned,
were excluded from these calculations.
Results
Figure 2 displays the distribution of salivary cotinine con-
centrations among women on the logarithmic scale. Vertical
lines separate imputed smoking categories and mark the
mean concentration for self-reported smokers. Notable fea-
tures of the distribution include its clear delineation as a mix-
ture of three distinct components. The single bar on the far
left corresponds to cotinine concentrations below the level of
sensitivity of the assay (19% of women). Moving to the right,
the majority of women (65%) are seen to have detectable
concentrations below the level of passive exposure, with values

a unimodal distribution, moderately skewed to the left. The
distribution for men is similar to that of women.
Table 2 presents the main descriptive results for cotinine,
first in terms of imputed smoking status and then as a measure
of the magnitude of recent exposure among self-reported cur-
rent smokers. Cotinine concentrations indicate regular smok-
ing in 17.7% and occasional smoking in 1.8% of respondents,
whereas concentrations consistent with passive exposure
were observed in fewer than 1%. Age and gender trends were
analogous to those for self-reported smoking status, although
the age trend among women did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (p = .11). Moreover, cotinine classification was consis-
tentwithself-reportedsmokingstatusanduseofothertobacco
products for the vast majority of respondents. Of particular
interest, cotinine concentrations were below levels indicative
of smoking, occasional or regular, for 97.9% (95% CI 97.2%­
98.4%) of respondents who reported no current cigarette or
other tobacco use. Breaking this down further, self-report of
no tobacco use was validated for 99.8% (99.0%­99.9%) of
never smokers and 96.2% (94.8%­97.2%) of past smokers.
Among current smokers, mean cotinine concentration was
346 ng/ml (median 309 ng/ml) overall and decreased with age
in both men and women. For comparison, the mean concen-
tration among respondents reporting no tobacco use was 5.6
ng/ml, and the 75th percentile of the distribution was less than
0.4 ng/ml across age groups for both men and women.
Figure 3 illustrates several features of the relationship
between cotinine and smoking behavior. Salivary cotinine
increased significantly with both current smoking intensity
(cigarettes per day) and cumulative lifetime exposure
(pack-years), although cotinine concentrations exhibited
considerable variation at any given level of either variable
(cigarettes per day: adjusted R2 =.18, pack-years: adjusted
R2 =.16). In contrast, pack-years was a very strong predic-
tor of current smoking intensity, explaining over 90% of the
variation in number of cigarettes per day (R2 =.93), thus

suggesting a mechanism for the significant association be-
tween short-term and cumulative lifetime exposure.
Although the mixture distribution for cotinine is most
evident on the logarithmic scale, the square root transfor-
mation yields better symmetry within each smoking group
(albeit with multiple high outliers among nonsmokers) and
is more suitable for analysis.
Explanation of Missing Data
Cotinine values are provided for 2,260 (75.7%) respondents.
Missing data resulted primarily from failure to obtain a saliva
specimen (respondent refused: 9.2%, respondent tried but was
unable to do: 2.2%) or insufficient sample for assay (11.4%).
Cotinine was the last of five assays conducted on each salivary
specimen, and adequacy rates declined with each successive
assay (Gavrilova et al., this issue); overall, 86.9% of saliva
specimens processed for analysis were sufficient for cotinine
assay. Values were missing for an additional 1.4% of respon-
dents due to equipment problems during saliva collection (n =
7), loss of specimens in transit (n = 25, 1.0%), inability to iden-
tify the sample (n = 6), and a technical problem with the sam-
ple (n = 1). Cooperation rates during saliva collection did not
differ significantly by gender, age group, or smoking status;
cooperation is discussed in detail by Gavrilova and associates
(this issue).Among respondents who were willing to provide a
sample, women and those in the oldest age group were most
likely to be unable to do so. Likewise, a larger proportion of
processed samples were insufficient for assay among women
(17.9% vs. 8.1%, p < .0001). None of these sources of miss-
ingness differed significantly by smoking status.
It should also be noted that among the values of cotinine
obtained, 16.8% were below the limit of sensitivity of the
assay for both duplicates and have been assigned the value
of 0. These nondetectable concentrations were more com-
mon in women and with increasing age. The gender differ-
ence remained after controlling for smoking status.
Consistent with the nature of the measurement, nondetect-
able concentrations occurred almost entirely among self-
reported nonsmokers (never or past).
Discussion: Cotinine and Self-Reported Smoking Behavior
Self-reported nonsmoking was validated by cotinine levels
for the vast majority of past and never smokers, taking into
account use of other tobacco products. This high level of
agreement speaks not only to the validity of self-reported
smoking status among NSHAP respondents but also to the
success of the EPA-recommended method for deriving cut-
points from cotinine concentrations to determine smoking, or
exposure, categories. NSHAP provides these gender-specific
cotinine-based classification variables in its core data set.
Molander, Hansson, and Lunell (2001) found that older adults,
aged 65­76 years, had significantly decreased clearance of
cotinine compared with adults aged 22­43 years, but the dif-
ference was not clinically important. When investigating coti-
nine concentrations, factors such as body habitus and timing
of the most recent meal should be considered as potential
modifiers. NSHAP reports BMI, which can be used for this
purpose, as well as elapsed time since last food or beverage.
It is striking that cotinine concentrations, which measure
tobacco exposure within the past two or three days, exhibit a
significant positive association with pack-years, a measure of
cumulative lifetime exposure--apparently due to a strong as-
sociation between lifetime exposure and current smoking in-
tensity. In contrast, less variation in cotinine is explained by
current smoking intensity than might be expected. Several as-
pects of smoking behavior, in addition to factors that affect
nicotine metabolism and cotinine clearance, may account for
this unexplained variation. The manner in which a person
smokes, or smoking topography (e.g., number and frequency
of puffs, portion of cigarette smoked, depth of inhalation), af-
fects the amount of nicotine absorbed (Strasser, Pickworth,
Patterson, & Lerman, 2004), so that persons who smoke the
same number of cigarettes per day may have very different
cotinine levels. In addition, patterns of smoking (e.g., continu-
ously vs. at fixed periods during the day) could lead to differ-
ences in the elapsed time since the last cigarette was smoked at
the time of cotinine measurement (Campuzano et al., 2004).
Conclusions
NSHAP successfully acquired a range of measures of
smoking behaviors and alcohol use. These variables will serve
as important modifying or explanatory factors when examin-
ing key questions concerning social relationships, health, and
sexuality. The measures are well established and have been
used extensively in medical, social science, and other fields of
research. The data are of high quality, with response rates that
generally meet, or exceed, those of other comparable studies.
Prevalences for selected measures were compared with those
from other large national surveys and found to be similar.
Funding
The NSHAP is supported by the National Institutes of Health--the Na-
tional Institute on Aging, the Office of Women's Health Research, the Of-
fice of AIDS Research, and the Office of Behavioral and Social Science
Research (5R01AG021487).
